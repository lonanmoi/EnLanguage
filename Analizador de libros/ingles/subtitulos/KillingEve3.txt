1
00:00:08,188 --> 00:00:09,615
I believe there is

2
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:12,054
a female assassin
operating internationally,

3
00:00:12,079 --> 00:00:14,930
and she's targeted a number
of influential people.

4
00:00:15,215 --> 00:00:16,414
This one has asthma.

5
00:00:16,416 --> 00:00:18,220
You know I like the breathy ones.

6
00:00:18,513 --> 00:00:19,728
Bye-bye.

7
00:00:20,053 --> 00:00:23,321
A woman in London is leading
a department just to find you.

8
00:00:23,609 --> 00:00:24,808
Excuse the smell.

9
00:00:25,892 --> 00:00:27,083
What is this?

10
00:00:27,108 --> 00:00:29,175
- What's her name?
- Eve Polastri.

11
00:00:30,831 --> 00:00:33,264
There was a young woman, a nurse,

12
00:00:33,266 --> 00:00:34,925
who left the bathroom before I did.

13
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:36,383
I think I've met her.

14
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:43,968
Her hair is dark blonde, maybe honey.

15
00:00:44,311 --> 00:00:45,794
It was tied back.

16
00:00:46,524 --> 00:00:51,856
Uh, she was slim, about 25, 26.

17
00:00:52,987 --> 00:00:56,154
She had very delicate features.

18
00:00:56,963 --> 00:01:01,261
Her eyes are sort of catlike.
Wide, but alert.

19
00:01:02,948 --> 00:01:04,616
Her lips are full,

20
00:01:04,965 --> 00:01:06,711
she has a long neck,

21
00:01:06,933 --> 00:01:08,584
high cheek bones.

22
00:01:10,437 --> 00:01:13,543
Skin is smooth and bright.

23
00:01:16,148 --> 00:01:18,279
She had a lost look in her eye

24
00:01:19,291 --> 00:01:24,595
that was both direct and also chilling.

25
00:01:26,524 --> 00:01:28,443
She's totally focused...

26
00:01:30,428 --> 00:01:32,862
yet almost entirely inaccessible.

27
00:01:35,462 --> 00:01:36,672
Uh...

28
00:01:37,564 --> 00:01:40,765
So, is that like a square
face or an oval face?

29
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:07,892
_

30
00:02:07,916 --> 00:02:09,916
_

31
00:02:11,509 --> 00:02:13,532
_

32
00:02:41,228 --> 00:02:42,594

33

All procedures at the client's own risk.

37
00:03:03,197 --> 00:03:05,950
Uh, I'm afraid Hortense was
called out unexpectedly.

38
00:03:06,064 --> 00:03:07,631
There is a cover nurse today.

39
00:03:07,656 --> 00:03:09,088
Oh. It's just, um...

40
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:12,535
- Yes?
- It's my birthday.

41
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:15,627
Hortense said she would be
doing something special.

42
00:03:15,629 --> 00:03:18,073
Happy birthday. I'll see what we can do.

43
00:03:18,375 --> 00:03:19,788
Oh... Thank you.

44
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:24,181
Oh. Can I confirm that
"Fruhstuck" is your safe word?

45
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,474
First time.

46
00:03:37,465 --> 00:03:40,190
You'll be fine. They're really nice.

47
00:03:41,121 --> 00:03:42,362
Oh, I hope not!

48
00:04:04,837 --> 00:04:06,136
You're late.

49
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:09,096
- I'm sorry. I had to...
- Take off your clothes.

50
00:04:28,713 --> 00:04:31,847
I see you are a regular
here at Hot Medica.

51
00:04:34,234 --> 00:04:36,240
It says here that last time you received

52
00:04:36,242 --> 00:04:38,409
a vigorous scrotal massage.

53
00:04:38,411 --> 00:04:42,195
Yes, but... did Hortense
tell you it was my birthday?

54
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:45,216
Oh. What? You think you are special?

55
00:04:46,553 --> 00:04:48,686
You think you deserve special treatment?

56
00:04:49,189 --> 00:04:50,443
No.

57
00:04:50,819 --> 00:04:52,054
Okay.

58
00:05:03,023 --> 00:05:04,894
Nobody gets special treatment.

59
00:05:09,205 --> 00:05:10,410
Cold?

60
00:05:12,918 --> 00:05:14,561
Mmm! Ah!

61
00:05:20,999 --> 00:05:23,333
Fruhstuck! Fruhstuck!

62
00:05:25,668 --> 00:05:26,875
Fruhstuck!

63
00:05:26,965 --> 00:05:28,932
Safe word! You have to stop!

64
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:38,569
What are you doing?

65
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:40,509
Please!

66
00:06:00,089 --> 00:06:01,224
Look at me.

67
00:06:02,424 --> 00:06:03,618
Look at me.

68
00:06:54,747 --> 00:06:56,890
Is she laying out of her ass?

69
00:06:57,839 --> 00:07:00,302
I think it's, uh, general muck.

70
00:07:01,151 --> 00:07:02,453
Is your job full-time?

71
00:07:02,455 --> 00:07:05,751
- Yeah. Uh, can we still eat it?
- I think so.

72
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:09,260
- And some late nights?
- Um, yep.

73
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:11,095
I'm gonna Google if we can eat it.

74
00:07:12,242 --> 00:07:13,974
Is it at Vauxhall Cross?

75
00:07:14,617 --> 00:07:17,802
Uh, no. It's at a private location.

76
00:07:17,804 --> 00:07:20,592
- It's off the books, so...
- Is it safe?

77
00:07:21,365 --> 00:07:24,766
It says it should be okay,
but definitely sniff it first.

78
00:07:27,619 --> 00:07:28,885
And the job?

79
00:07:29,783 --> 00:07:31,549
Oh, yes. It's just gathering

80
00:07:31,551 --> 00:07:34,180
and analyzing information
about someone. It's not...

81
00:07:34,934 --> 00:07:36,188
You know, I don't think
we should eat it.

82
00:07:36,213 --> 00:07:37,246
Risky?

83
00:07:37,373 --> 00:07:39,263
- Yeah.
- Is the job risky?

84
00:07:39,592 --> 00:07:42,260
Oh. It's about as dangerous
as eating that egg would be.

85
00:07:42,262 --> 00:07:44,128
You just said the egg was too risky!

86
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:45,496
No, no. Wait, no.

87
00:07:45,498 --> 00:07:48,216
I mean, the worst that could happen

88
00:07:48,241 --> 00:07:50,334
is I would get the shits at my computer

89
00:07:50,336 --> 00:07:51,865
because of a bad sandwich.

90
00:07:53,425 --> 00:07:54,730
You seem happy.

91
00:07:55,541 --> 00:07:58,042
I'm just glad I have a job.

92
00:07:59,797 --> 00:08:01,830
All chickens lay eggs
out of their arsehole.

93
00:08:02,177 --> 00:08:03,518
I love how you say that.

94
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:07,385
- Arsehole.
- Oh. Say it again.

95
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:09,087
Arsehole.

96
00:08:09,689 --> 00:08:12,924
She had an induced asthma attack
at a political fundraiser.

97
00:08:12,926 --> 00:08:14,559
She was the primary donor.

98
00:08:14,561 --> 00:08:16,582
Yeah, I read about it this morning.

99
00:08:16,996 --> 00:08:19,253
Let me guess. You think it was a woman.

100
00:08:19,658 --> 00:08:20,932
Well, she was found in the ladies.

101
00:08:20,934 --> 00:08:23,098
So, yes, she's going
on the wall, you ass.

102
00:08:23,123 --> 00:08:24,709
Oh, hello.

103
00:08:24,734 --> 00:08:26,533
Yeah. Childcare emergency.

104
00:08:26,684 --> 00:08:27,800
Oh, that's fine.

105
00:08:31,261 --> 00:08:32,344
Oh, thanks.

106
00:08:32,606 --> 00:08:35,146
Never have a baby in your 60s.

107
00:08:35,148 --> 00:08:38,049
Don't follow behind.
She's farted. It's horrendous.

108
00:08:38,051 --> 00:08:39,431
Oh, God.

109
00:08:40,650 --> 00:08:42,533
You're beautiful, but stinky!

110
00:08:43,656 --> 00:08:45,668
Oh, great. The e-fit has come through.

111
00:08:45,930 --> 00:08:47,341
We have some news.

112
00:08:48,106 --> 00:08:49,398
Uh, what's happened?

113
00:08:50,483 --> 00:08:53,564
- There's been another kill.
- Ah, yes. Carla de Mann.

114
00:08:53,566 --> 00:08:56,033
I've already asked Kenny
to put her case up on...

115
00:08:57,475 --> 00:08:58,474
No?

116
00:09:00,042 --> 00:09:01,438
His name is Zhang Wu.

117
00:09:01,534 --> 00:09:03,841
He was a Chinese colonel
visiting Berlin.

118
00:09:03,843 --> 00:09:05,768
Heads up, cyber warfare.

119
00:09:05,869 --> 00:09:08,336
In other words, he's a hacker
for the Chinese military.

120
00:09:08,383 --> 00:09:11,649
Murdered during a very specific

121
00:09:11,651 --> 00:09:13,918
fetish thing, where he...

122
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,553
He liked having small
surgical operations

123
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:17,655
performed on his body
and having his balls clamped.

124
00:09:17,657 --> 00:09:19,002
He was a regular there.

125
00:09:19,171 --> 00:09:20,169
Thanks.

126
00:09:20,194 --> 00:09:23,443
Suspect a Caucasian woman
in her mid-20s,

127
00:09:23,542 --> 00:09:25,909
claimed she was covering
for the other surgeon girl.

128
00:09:26,165 --> 00:09:27,431
- Fetish nurse.
- Thank you.

129
00:09:27,433 --> 00:09:28,775
- Witnesses?
- One.

130
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,466
The receptionist
signed her in as a temp.

131
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:33,704
Okay, great, well, let's get
this e-fit image over to Berlin

132
00:09:33,706 --> 00:09:34,972
and get her identified.

133
00:09:40,847 --> 00:09:42,393
Why are you all being weird?

134
00:09:42,743 --> 00:09:44,610
She gave a name at the desk.

135
00:09:44,684 --> 00:09:45,777
Okay.

136
00:09:46,087 --> 00:09:47,999
She said her name was Eve Polastri.

137
00:09:50,766 --> 00:09:51,966
Jesus.

138
00:09:59,024 --> 00:10:00,256
Do you smoke?

139
00:10:00,437 --> 00:10:02,066
Uh, no.

140
00:10:02,391 --> 00:10:04,435
Nor do I. Shame.

141
00:10:05,088 --> 00:10:06,403
Now would be good.

142
00:10:07,495 --> 00:10:08,661
Yeah.

143
00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:11,185
Please don't take me off the team.

144
00:10:11,778 --> 00:10:15,112
I can't take you off a team
that doesn't exist.

145
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:19,740
Your actions are your own.

146
00:10:20,808 --> 00:10:22,244
What do you want to do?

147
00:10:43,843 --> 00:10:45,563
Bill, you're coming with me.

148
00:10:45,814 --> 00:10:47,039
Take Elena.

149
00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:49,964
Traveling makes my dandruff flare up.

150
00:10:50,093 --> 00:10:51,292
Yes, take Elena!

151
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:52,616
I don't think Elena should go.

152
00:10:52,618 --> 00:10:54,285
I need your German,

153
00:10:54,287 --> 00:10:57,100
your experience, your Berlin contacts.

154
00:10:57,125 --> 00:10:58,389
This is my first chance

155
00:10:58,391 --> 00:11:00,054
to investigate this woman for real.

156
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:01,225
I need you.

157
00:11:01,227 --> 00:11:02,661
Oh, you're too sweet.

158
00:11:02,862 --> 00:11:05,262
If there was ever a reason
to join this team,

159
00:11:05,264 --> 00:11:06,964
it was to get back into the field.

160
00:11:06,966 --> 00:11:09,898
It's one trip, Bill. Huh? One trip.

161
00:11:10,104 --> 00:11:12,919
Oh, God, I'm going to die, aren't I?

162
00:11:13,245 --> 00:11:17,942
Hmm? Daddy's going to die, isn't he?

163
00:11:17,944 --> 00:11:19,143
Oh, come on.

164
00:11:19,145 --> 00:11:20,847
It's not like
she's gonna still be there.

165
00:11:21,167 --> 00:11:22,569
I'm joking.

166
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:27,418
I haven't done
anything like this before.

167
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:29,020
Me neither.

168
00:11:30,225 --> 00:11:31,844
- Take your hair down.
- Oh.

169
00:11:31,869 --> 00:11:35,237
Okay. It's a bit... I didn't wash it.

170
00:11:36,095 --> 00:11:37,294
My husband thinks

171
00:11:37,296 --> 00:11:39,363
I'm with the tour group
for another hour, so...

172
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:42,696
- I love your accent.
- Thank you.

173
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:45,669
What are you doing in Berlin?

174
00:11:45,671 --> 00:11:48,272
I'm, uh, just killing time
until my friends turn up.

175
00:11:48,274 --> 00:11:51,048
You are so sexy.

176
00:11:51,073 --> 00:11:52,373
Oh, my.

177
00:11:54,004 --> 00:11:56,013
- What are we doing?
- I don't know!

178
00:11:58,384 --> 00:12:00,707
- No, no. Keep your coat on.
- Oh.

179
00:12:00,923 --> 00:12:04,121
- Keep your bag on your shoulder.
- Oh. Are we not...

180
00:12:04,123 --> 00:12:06,624
- Your clothes are too nice.
- Oh.

181
00:12:06,626 --> 00:12:08,859
I'm going to call you Eve, okay?

182
00:12:09,105 --> 00:12:11,295
Um, okay. Why?

183
00:12:11,297 --> 00:12:13,985
It's just a little, uh,
biblical fantasy thing.

184
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,453
Um, okay.

185
00:12:15,878 --> 00:12:17,250
Do you want me to call you Adam?

186
00:12:17,275 --> 00:12:19,373
No, no. That's... That's okay.

187
00:12:20,606 --> 00:12:23,398
- You ready?
- Oh, God! Okay.

188
00:12:30,885 --> 00:12:35,721
Now I am going to hide
and you are going to find me.

189
00:12:47,828 --> 00:12:48,994
You leaving me?

190
00:12:49,449 --> 00:12:50,901
Oh, Jesus.

191
00:12:51,144 --> 00:12:52,470
What is wrong with you?

192
00:12:52,472 --> 00:12:54,656
I thought you had
a parent's evening tonight.

193
00:12:54,681 --> 00:12:57,441
I did, but I lied and said
they were all angels

194
00:12:57,443 --> 00:12:59,883
so I could come home and do this.

195
00:12:59,972 --> 00:13:01,169
- Mmm.
- Mmm.

196
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:06,199
You need a hand?

197
00:13:06,542 --> 00:13:10,177
Yes, please. I think it's mated
with the wardrobe.

198
00:13:13,826 --> 00:13:15,025
Oh.

199
00:13:17,328 --> 00:13:18,797
You're so strong.

200
00:13:19,119 --> 00:13:20,585
All that maths.

201
00:13:24,422 --> 00:13:25,748
Ugh.

202
00:13:27,373 --> 00:13:28,508
Are you?

203
00:13:29,587 --> 00:13:30,897
- What?
- Leaving me?

204
00:13:32,218 --> 00:13:34,822
Oh, my God. Yeah.

205
00:13:35,014 --> 00:13:36,831
I'm leaving you. I'm sorry.

206
00:13:36,856 --> 00:13:39,836
You're just too... energy efficient.

207
00:13:40,419 --> 00:13:43,354
I'm going to Berlin.
Following up a lead.

208
00:13:43,356 --> 00:13:45,256
It'll only be a couple of days.

209
00:13:45,258 --> 00:13:46,423
Okay.

210
00:13:49,507 --> 00:13:51,301
- Are you annoyed?
- No.

211
00:13:52,404 --> 00:13:53,764
Label your suitcase.

212
00:13:53,766 --> 00:13:55,290
You don't want to lose another one.

213
00:13:55,709 --> 00:13:57,743
That was not my fault.

214
00:14:01,464 --> 00:14:02,585
Are you okay?

215
00:14:02,679 --> 00:14:03,893
Yeah, of course.

216
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:05,309
Label it.

217
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:06,811
I will.

218
00:14:07,811 --> 00:14:10,331
This whole thing
is such a pain in the ass.

219
00:14:10,521 --> 00:14:14,558
I know, you hate
your new job, don't you?

220
00:14:15,510 --> 00:14:16,716
I hate it.

221
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:18,821
Hmm?

222
00:15:08,856 --> 00:15:12,224
Now, the most likely people
to assassinate a Chinese leader

223
00:15:12,226 --> 00:15:13,725
with a penchant for fetish

224
00:15:13,727 --> 00:15:15,460
- are the Chinese.
- The Chinese, I know.

225
00:15:15,462 --> 00:15:17,557
I want to find out
who's been looking into it here.

226
00:15:19,472 --> 00:15:21,171
Why do you think she used your name?

227
00:15:22,666 --> 00:15:23,825
I don't know.

228
00:15:49,663 --> 00:15:51,680
Let me get it. Let me get it. I got it.

229
00:15:55,168 --> 00:15:56,801
Bill! Ah!

230
00:15:56,874 --> 00:15:58,841
_

231
00:16:01,230 --> 00:16:03,230
_

232
00:16:03,477 --> 00:16:04,575
Hi. Eve.

233
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:05,950
Weber. Nice to meet you.

234
00:16:05,975 --> 00:16:07,779
Thank you so much for getting us access.

235
00:16:07,781 --> 00:16:09,834
Anything for this old tart.

236
00:16:12,491 --> 00:16:14,591
_

237
00:16:14,616 --> 00:16:16,283
No, no, no. Put it down. Put it down.

238
00:16:16,308 --> 00:16:17,760
- Why?
- Chivalry.

239
00:16:17,859 --> 00:16:19,158
Since when?

240
00:16:19,359 --> 00:16:20,819
Danke schoen.

241
00:16:23,112 --> 00:16:24,362
This way, please.

242
00:16:24,364 --> 00:16:26,973
What can you tell me
about the nurse with my name?

243
00:16:27,038 --> 00:16:29,639
Sadly, very little.
She just disappeared.

244
00:16:31,171 --> 00:16:32,904
And the victim, Zhang Wu?

245
00:16:34,530 --> 00:16:36,076
He was lying here,

246
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:40,509
and he was poisoned
with carbon monoxide,

247
00:16:41,301 --> 00:16:44,189
and his balls were, um...
I don't know the word.

248
00:16:44,311 --> 00:16:45,577
- "Clamped."
- "Clamped"?

249
00:16:45,675 --> 00:16:48,709
Clamped. Ja. That sounds right.

250
00:16:49,098 --> 00:16:50,384
Any other exits?

251
00:16:50,574 --> 00:16:52,157
Nope. She went out the front door.

252
00:16:52,182 --> 00:16:53,225
Oh.

253
00:16:53,227 --> 00:16:56,176
All their clients use
fake names and cash,

254
00:16:56,201 --> 00:16:59,197
so we can't get any more
witness accounts.

255
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:03,106
I imagine the clientele
aren't keen on CCTV here.

256
00:17:03,131 --> 00:17:05,012
Can we see the autopsy report?

257
00:17:05,037 --> 00:17:08,215
Jin, the eccentric Chinese attach�,

258
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:09,652
ordered a second opinion.

259
00:17:09,854 --> 00:17:10,850
Why?

260
00:17:10,875 --> 00:17:12,408
I assume the Chinese government

261
00:17:12,433 --> 00:17:14,466
weren't happy with the first,
but you'd have to ask him.

262
00:17:15,064 --> 00:17:16,659
How can I get hold of Jin?

263
00:17:16,684 --> 00:17:19,434
I'll give you his e-mail.
He never replies.

264
00:17:20,047 --> 00:17:22,307
Your best bet is the morgue, really.

265
00:17:23,190 --> 00:17:25,638
I'm sorry, Eve. It's a nice one though.

266
00:17:25,789 --> 00:17:28,339
Bit like the glitter morgue
in Charlottenburg.

267
00:17:32,453 --> 00:17:34,686
Yeah. I get you his e-mail. Hold on.

268
00:17:36,269 --> 00:17:38,517
Sounds like the Chinese
are trying to bury this case.

269
00:17:38,542 --> 00:17:41,194
Let's just get some lunch
and e-mail the attach�.

270
00:17:41,219 --> 00:17:42,322
There's a limit to what...

271
00:17:42,347 --> 00:17:43,579
You know, I'm gonna try something.

272
00:17:43,659 --> 00:17:45,562
You know what, can you watch this?

273
00:17:45,851 --> 00:17:46,975
Okay.

274
00:17:49,349 --> 00:17:50,737
Hey.

275
00:17:53,731 --> 00:17:56,646
Kenny, if I give you
someone's e-mail address,

276
00:17:56,671 --> 00:17:58,506
can you find out where they
might be right now.

277
00:17:58,531 --> 00:18:00,159
If their diary is connected, yes.

278
00:18:00,184 --> 00:18:01,637
Great. I'm sending it to you.

279
00:18:02,323 --> 00:18:03,502
Of course, Bill.

280
00:18:03,654 --> 00:18:05,264
- See you later.
- Okay.

281
00:18:05,727 --> 00:18:07,482
- Thanks so much, Weber.
- No problem.

282
00:18:07,507 --> 00:18:08,625
Bye.

283
00:18:09,069 --> 00:18:10,091
Later?

284
00:18:10,116 --> 00:18:12,323
He's going to send
the e-fit to the receptionist.

285
00:18:12,348 --> 00:18:15,542
Oh, great. Uh, Kenny's
finding Jin for us.

286
00:18:15,567 --> 00:18:17,002
And as for you...

287
00:18:18,153 --> 00:18:19,304
Charlottenburg?

288
00:18:20,745 --> 00:18:21,967
Yeah.

289
00:18:22,149 --> 00:18:23,748
I got his mobile from his e-mail.

290
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:25,582
I'm sending his precise location now.

291
00:18:25,745 --> 00:18:28,279
- That is so creepy.
- I know, sorry.

292
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,739
Okay, thanks. Bye.

293
00:18:31,809 --> 00:18:33,091
Where's my bag?

294
00:18:34,361 --> 00:18:36,060
- What?
- Are you serious?

295
00:18:36,385 --> 00:18:38,930
Niko's gonna have
a field day about this.

296
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:43,893
- Bill, I asked you to watch the bag...
- Yeah, yeah.

297
00:18:58,584 --> 00:18:59,779
What?

298
00:19:12,599 --> 00:19:13,798
Aw...

299
00:19:16,303 --> 00:19:17,897
Poor baby.

300
00:19:22,939 --> 00:19:24,128
Ugh.

301
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:26,009
I thought I could smell something.

302
00:19:29,274 --> 00:19:31,643
Sorry, are you having
a nice little holiday here?

303
00:19:31,668 --> 00:19:32,873
Are you?

304
00:19:33,022 --> 00:19:35,784
I booked you in for one night.

305
00:19:35,824 --> 00:19:38,351
So? I like Berlin.

306
00:19:39,259 --> 00:19:41,718
- Have you been before?
- Yes.

307
00:19:42,818 --> 00:19:44,008
Have you seen the Wall?

308
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:45,752
- Yes.
- The Jewish Museum?

309
00:19:45,777 --> 00:19:47,979
- Listen.
- That is massively poignant.

310
00:19:48,495 --> 00:19:49,780
I have a job for you.

311
00:19:50,558 --> 00:19:51,709
Off the record.

312
00:19:52,197 --> 00:19:54,149
The woman, Eve Polasi...

313
00:19:54,398 --> 00:19:56,549
- Polastri.
- Polastri.

314
00:19:57,965 --> 00:19:59,124
She's here.

315
00:20:00,669 --> 00:20:03,748
She's investigating your work.

316
00:20:05,436 --> 00:20:06,999
Did you see where I did it?

317
00:20:07,753 --> 00:20:09,864
Very cute, yes.

318
00:20:17,035 --> 00:20:19,135
These don't look like you.

319
00:20:19,464 --> 00:20:20,799
Why are you so worried?

320
00:20:20,801 --> 00:20:22,173
- Aren't you?
- No!

321
00:20:22,471 --> 00:20:24,046
I don't even think about her.

322
00:20:25,068 --> 00:20:27,556
Why does she think it was you?

323
00:20:31,687 --> 00:20:33,024
I want you to watch her.

324
00:20:33,541 --> 00:20:35,413
I need to know who she meets.

325
00:20:36,497 --> 00:20:38,631
This is me asking you.

326
00:20:39,257 --> 00:20:40,543
Not them, okay?

327
00:20:41,631 --> 00:20:44,098
Just watch her.

328
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:48,120
Promise you won't be naughty.

329
00:20:48,784 --> 00:20:50,718
I promise I won't be naughty.

330
00:20:52,643 --> 00:20:55,400
Oh. Sorry, they gave me
the key downstair...

331
00:20:55,542 --> 00:20:57,177
Oh, God, I'm sorry.

332
00:20:58,039 --> 00:21:00,245
Oh. Is this part of...

333
00:21:01,414 --> 00:21:04,281
Hi, my name is... Uh, this is my friend.

334
00:21:04,768 --> 00:21:06,107
Her name is Pamela.

335
00:21:08,148 --> 00:21:11,247
- Hi, Pamela. I'm her...
- Angry uncle.

336
00:21:11,304 --> 00:21:12,471
Oh.

337
00:21:19,759 --> 00:21:22,234
Find out what they're doing.

338
00:21:22,573 --> 00:21:24,754
Find out who they're meeting.

339
00:21:25,809 --> 00:21:27,947
Don't do anything stupid.

340
00:21:36,899 --> 00:21:39,600
Wow! He was really good.

341
00:21:40,650 --> 00:21:43,551
- Are these for me?
- Oh, yeah.

342
00:21:48,929 --> 00:21:50,825
- I'm really sorry.
- Mmm.

343
00:21:51,468 --> 00:21:53,698
Forget it. I hate all my clothes.

344
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:55,377
Niko's gonna slay me, though.

345
00:21:56,631 --> 00:22:01,978
Oh, plus, the green scarf
he gave me is in it. Damn it.

346
00:22:02,516 --> 00:22:03,848
I did you a favor then.

347
00:22:04,532 --> 00:22:07,569
Oh. Okay. Come on.

348
00:22:15,478 --> 00:22:17,034
Jin?

349
00:22:17,530 --> 00:22:21,523
_

350
00:22:21,983 --> 00:22:24,271
_

351
00:22:24,446 --> 00:22:27,447
Sorry, friends. I don't know
anything about Colonel Zhang.

352
00:22:30,269 --> 00:22:31,803
My name is Eve Polastri.

353
00:22:35,609 --> 00:22:38,009
Strange coincidence about your name.

354
00:22:38,127 --> 00:22:39,731
Yeah. Bit creepy.

355
00:22:40,114 --> 00:22:43,640
Weber, um, mentioned a second autopsy?

356
00:22:43,884 --> 00:22:44,969
Why would you need one?

357
00:22:44,994 --> 00:22:47,535
Ah, yes, that's just come through.

358
00:22:47,621 --> 00:22:48,821
Can we see it?

359
00:22:49,643 --> 00:22:51,209
After you've been vetted.

360
00:22:51,211 --> 00:22:52,877
- When will that be?
- The usual.

361
00:22:52,879 --> 00:22:53,915
Six months or so.

362
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:55,225
Six months?

363
00:22:55,250 --> 00:22:57,317
It's in your interests to cooperate.

364
00:22:57,342 --> 00:22:59,308
Listen, your colleague was targeted...

365
00:22:59,333 --> 00:23:01,687
I'm joking! I was joking!

366
00:23:01,763 --> 00:23:03,187
I'll get it for you.

367
00:23:03,585 --> 00:23:05,252
What do you know about this guy?

368
00:23:05,413 --> 00:23:08,269
Internally, the guy
was known as "Fat Panda,"

369
00:23:08,763 --> 00:23:10,724
which is a little racist.

370
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,070
Fattist, come to that.

371
00:23:13,431 --> 00:23:16,911
But I hear that he started it
so, you know, we went along.

372
00:23:17,023 --> 00:23:19,916
He was based in China,
but over here in Berlin a lot.

373
00:23:20,154 --> 00:23:23,539
He was popular, good leader, nice man.

374
00:23:23,791 --> 00:23:25,763
His death has shocked a lot of people.

375
00:23:26,105 --> 00:23:27,581
Who do you think murdered him?

376
00:23:27,934 --> 00:23:31,430
Spoiler alert.
The new autopsy report says

377
00:23:31,531 --> 00:23:33,113
he died of a heart attack.

378
00:23:34,132 --> 00:23:36,689
- Wait, what?
- Doesn't that sound better?

379
00:23:36,714 --> 00:23:38,971
The nurse who was supposed
to be on duty was drugged.

380
00:23:38,996 --> 00:23:40,736
This was a blatant assassination.

381
00:23:40,761 --> 00:23:42,601
And by the operative I'm looking for.

382
00:23:42,874 --> 00:23:45,079
And as the Chinese attach�,

383
00:23:45,194 --> 00:23:47,135
I'm saying it was a heart attack.

384
00:23:48,201 --> 00:23:51,324
Listen, the Chinese government
are freaking out.

385
00:23:51,419 --> 00:23:55,606
It's a PR nightmare.
This story cannot exist.

386
00:23:55,932 --> 00:23:57,416
What's the Chinese story?

387
00:23:58,311 --> 00:24:02,146
The new autopsy concludes that
he took the initiative himself

388
00:24:02,148 --> 00:24:04,007
when the covering nurse left the room,

389
00:24:04,273 --> 00:24:07,849
working the forceps
to experience a shock of pain

390
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:10,575
that triggered a cardiac arrest.

391
00:24:11,512 --> 00:24:12,705
Not my thing.

392
00:24:12,730 --> 00:24:15,175
- Not his, either.
- Why? He's a masochist.

393
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:17,328
Look, kinks are totally specific.

394
00:24:17,330 --> 00:24:19,299
It's not just about pain,
it's a contract.

395
00:24:19,324 --> 00:24:21,591
It's about someone else taking control.

396
00:24:21,785 --> 00:24:25,914
A "spankophile" wouldn't just
spank himself, would he?

397
00:24:29,841 --> 00:24:31,629
I mean, what would be the point in that?

398
00:24:32,979 --> 00:24:34,665
I'm afraid we have run out of time.

399
00:24:34,690 --> 00:24:36,381
- Wait.
- Maybe Miss Polastri

400
00:24:36,383 --> 00:24:37,889
would like to join me
for dinner tonight?

401
00:24:37,914 --> 00:24:40,948
Perhaps we could continue
the conversation then.

402
00:24:40,973 --> 00:24:43,584
I might have something
you could extract from me.

403
00:24:45,866 --> 00:24:48,176
He wants to have sex with you.

404
00:24:48,291 --> 00:24:50,664
- Don't.
- He wants to fondle you.

405
00:24:50,689 --> 00:24:54,124
Only because you got him all hot
with that, you know, kink stuff.

406
00:24:54,149 --> 00:24:55,945
It's an important distinction.

407
00:24:56,195 --> 00:24:58,761
That you know so much about because...

408
00:24:58,786 --> 00:25:00,661
I lived here for eight years.

409
00:25:01,003 --> 00:25:02,057
And?

410
00:25:02,082 --> 00:25:04,483
I said yes to everything
for five of them.

411
00:25:04,748 --> 00:25:06,704
Dark horse, aren't I?

412
00:25:07,303 --> 00:25:08,715
I'm going to report your bag.

413
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:11,553
You get yourself something nice
to wear for tonight.

414
00:25:11,578 --> 00:25:13,333
I'm taking you out after your dinner.

415
00:25:13,528 --> 00:25:16,096
Uh, shall I pick up some fetish gear?

416
00:25:16,257 --> 00:25:18,240
Only if they have rubber chaps.

417
00:25:28,788 --> 00:25:30,770
Ugh! Just talk.

418
00:25:31,169 --> 00:25:34,227
Okay, Jin Yeong is a big deal
within Chinese Intelligence.

419
00:25:34,252 --> 00:25:36,777
He has three PhDs and a massive brain.

420
00:25:36,865 --> 00:25:39,067
Carolyn says if he claims
he has something,

421
00:25:39,092 --> 00:25:40,250
he will have something.

422
00:25:40,275 --> 00:25:41,535
Is he patriotic?

423
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:43,313
Nothing to imply he isn't.

424
00:25:43,489 --> 00:25:45,623
- Any scandals?
- 'Fraid not.

425
00:25:45,648 --> 00:25:48,582
Carolyn says to play his game,
however gross.

426
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:49,916
Wait, wait, wait.

427
00:25:49,941 --> 00:25:51,226
Hold on, wait.

428
00:25:58,040 --> 00:25:59,603
This is a nightmare.

429
00:26:02,637 --> 00:26:04,702
Do you want any other sizes, madam?

430
00:26:05,091 --> 00:26:07,516
Uh, no. Thank you. Danke.

431
00:26:08,677 --> 00:26:09,909
Are you shopping?

432
00:26:10,004 --> 00:26:12,210
Hey, you know what,
my suitcase was stolen,

433
00:26:12,212 --> 00:26:13,444
so I have to.

434
00:26:13,446 --> 00:26:16,185
God, you know when an outfit
is missing something,

435
00:26:16,210 --> 00:26:17,710
but you just don't know what?

436
00:26:17,855 --> 00:26:20,355
- If in doubt, don't go out.
- So useful.

437
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:21,830
Thank you. Okay. Bye.

438
00:26:25,176 --> 00:26:26,464
Excuse me.

439
00:26:41,649 --> 00:26:42,838
Oh.

440
00:26:50,049 --> 00:26:51,267
Hmm.

441
00:27:09,728 --> 00:27:11,607
Oh, hey. Hi, darling.

442
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:14,721
God, I'm so sorry I didn't call before.

443
00:27:14,746 --> 00:27:16,278
I was just...

444
00:27:16,303 --> 00:27:17,675
Hey, darling.

445
00:27:17,949 --> 00:27:19,185
What's going on?

446
00:27:19,547 --> 00:27:22,316
- Um...
- Hi!

447
00:27:23,488 --> 00:27:26,567
Oh, hi! Oh, guys, hi!

448
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:30,693
Oh, my God, I'm...
I'm so sorry I can't be there.

449
00:27:30,695 --> 00:27:32,829
I had this last-minute work thing.

450
00:27:32,831 --> 00:27:34,931
- More for us!
- Niko is smashing it!

451
00:27:34,933 --> 00:27:36,283
Oh, fantastic.

452
00:27:36,486 --> 00:27:37,823
Just give me one minute.

453
00:27:38,818 --> 00:27:39,918
Hey!

454
00:27:40,072 --> 00:27:42,425
Oh, my God, why didn't you remind me?

455
00:27:43,024 --> 00:27:45,408
I didn't want to stress you out
about your work thing.

456
00:27:45,410 --> 00:27:47,977
Yeah, but we could have rescheduled.

457
00:27:47,979 --> 00:27:49,745
It's been in the diary for months.

458
00:27:49,981 --> 00:27:52,682
But... Okay.

459
00:27:52,914 --> 00:27:56,160
Oh, what's that?

460
00:27:56,761 --> 00:27:58,321
Oh, uh... a dress.

461
00:27:58,323 --> 00:28:00,390
I didn't have the right clothes
for tonight.

462
00:28:01,014 --> 00:28:02,067
For Bill?

463
00:28:02,728 --> 00:28:05,704
No, for a contact here.
He wanted to go someplace fancy.

464
00:28:05,729 --> 00:28:07,524
Apparently, I have
to make an impression.

465
00:28:08,215 --> 00:28:09,571
You'll look gorgeous.

466
00:28:10,618 --> 00:28:11,848
Yeah, I doubt that.

467
00:28:13,086 --> 00:28:15,238
Well, you go back to the gang.

468
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:17,474
And Tell them I'm sorry
I can't be there. I'm just...

469
00:28:17,476 --> 00:28:18,798
Saving the world.

470
00:28:20,011 --> 00:28:21,602
Yeah, well...

471
00:28:23,035 --> 00:28:24,240
you guys have fun.

472
00:28:25,863 --> 00:28:27,090
Is that Bill?

473
00:28:27,902 --> 00:28:29,378
Uh, yeah.

474
00:28:30,208 --> 00:28:31,875
Say hi from me.

475
00:28:32,791 --> 00:28:33,927
I will.

476
00:28:34,572 --> 00:28:35,736
Good night.

477
00:28:36,496 --> 00:28:37,641
Night.

478
00:28:42,727 --> 00:28:45,012
- Room service.
- Coming.

479
00:28:47,102 --> 00:28:48,295
Coming, coming.

480
00:28:50,882 --> 00:28:52,034
Ugh.

481
00:28:52,854 --> 00:28:54,065
Thank you.

482
00:28:56,490 --> 00:28:58,381
Tell them I'm sorry I can't be there.

483
00:28:58,383 --> 00:29:00,706
- I'm just...
- Saving the world.

484
00:29:01,019 --> 00:29:02,452
Yeah, well...

485
00:29:03,088 --> 00:29:04,320
you guys have fun.

486
00:29:05,423 --> 00:29:06,625
Is that Bill?

487
00:29:07,125 --> 00:29:08,424
Uh, yeah.

488
00:29:08,478 --> 00:29:09,970
Say hi from me.

489
00:29:15,271 --> 00:29:16,652
You guys have fun.

490
00:29:17,361 --> 00:29:18,572
Is that Bill?

491
00:29:19,237 --> 00:29:20,637
Uh, yeah.

492
00:29:20,639 --> 00:29:22,068
Say hi from me.

493
00:29:22,931 --> 00:29:24,779
I will. Okay. Good night.

494
00:29:26,299 --> 00:29:28,878
You can't wear a bra with that dress.

495
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:30,723
Whip it off.
This is an important meeting.

496
00:29:30,748 --> 00:29:33,756
Oh, and important meetings
require women to go braless?

497
00:29:33,781 --> 00:29:37,014
No, dresses like that
require women to go braless.

498
00:29:37,039 --> 00:29:38,500
A monkey could tell you that.

499
00:29:38,623 --> 00:29:40,924
If he has something,
you have to get it out of him.

500
00:29:40,926 --> 00:29:42,218
Oh, please.

501
00:29:42,649 --> 00:29:44,775
I haven't flirted since the late '90s.

502
00:29:45,158 --> 00:29:47,725
- How's Niko?
- I think he's jealous.

503
00:29:47,750 --> 00:29:51,110
Which I like, but also find annoying.

504
00:29:51,135 --> 00:29:52,372
Jealous of me?

505
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:55,294
Gosh. What does he think I'm doing here?

506
00:29:55,319 --> 00:29:57,019
Skulking to your hotel room

507
00:29:57,044 --> 00:29:59,911
and convincing you to take off your bra?

508
00:30:04,307 --> 00:30:06,013
Have you ever fancied me?

509
00:30:07,089 --> 00:30:08,176
Uh...

510
00:30:09,609 --> 00:30:11,236
- No.
- Hmm.

511
00:30:11,579 --> 00:30:13,419
- You me?
- No.

512
00:30:14,043 --> 00:30:14,955
Hmm.

513
00:30:15,122 --> 00:30:16,757
Well, that's a relief.

514
00:30:17,904 --> 00:30:22,121
So, tell me what happened
in Charlottenburg.

515
00:30:22,146 --> 00:30:23,351
Everything happened.

516
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:26,436
- Wait. Men?
- Yes.

517
00:30:26,438 --> 00:30:27,813
Were you gay?

518
00:30:28,373 --> 00:30:31,747
Uh... I just fall in love with
whoever I fall in love with.

519
00:30:31,956 --> 00:30:33,576
How many men have you been in love with?

520
00:30:33,578 --> 00:30:35,445
Hundreds. Does Keiko know?

521
00:30:35,447 --> 00:30:37,420
She's got her own thing going on.

522
00:30:38,283 --> 00:30:39,690
Wait, so you guys...

523
00:30:40,552 --> 00:30:43,653
Well... I really wanted a baby,

524
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:46,661
and she was rich and ovulating, so...

525
00:30:46,686 --> 00:30:48,820
But you guys are
like the perfect couple.

526
00:30:48,994 --> 00:30:50,377
We're a good team.

527
00:30:52,130 --> 00:30:53,396
Wow.

528
00:30:55,875 --> 00:30:57,059
Bill.

529
00:31:00,509 --> 00:31:03,433
Do you want to hear
something really freaky?

530
00:31:03,458 --> 00:31:04,639
What?

531
00:31:04,936 --> 00:31:06,911
The conditions have to be just right,

532
00:31:07,812 --> 00:31:09,089
but sometimes...

533
00:31:10,742 --> 00:31:12,627
...we have sex.

534
00:31:13,181 --> 00:31:16,352
- You dirty perverts.
- I know.

535
00:31:17,827 --> 00:31:19,567
You ever been interested in women?

536
00:31:20,396 --> 00:31:22,395
Uh, no. Not like that.

537
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:25,762
Not even ones with delicate features,

538
00:31:25,764 --> 00:31:28,197
sort of catlike eyes

539
00:31:28,199 --> 00:31:30,300
that are completely inaccessible?

540
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:32,612
That is horribly unprofessional.

541
00:31:33,928 --> 00:31:35,196
Do you want to hear about her tits?

542
00:31:35,221 --> 00:31:37,907
- I knew it!
- I'm joking!

543
00:31:37,909 --> 00:31:40,082
- I knew it!
- Oh, come on!

544
00:31:40,345 --> 00:31:43,412
Let's go, I'm ready. What
are you going to do?

545
00:31:43,615 --> 00:31:45,547
I'll find a bar near the restaurant.

546
00:31:46,051 --> 00:31:48,467
I'll call you at 9:00
to give you an out.

547
00:31:52,490 --> 00:31:54,791
Of course I fancy you. You're gorgeous.

548
00:31:54,854 --> 00:31:56,393
Oh, stop it!

549
00:31:56,766 --> 00:31:58,328
Oh, uh, walk me to the train.

550
00:31:58,330 --> 00:32:00,770
I can't believe I'm
letting you out unsupervised.

551
00:32:01,104 --> 00:32:02,580
Speak for yourself.

552
00:32:20,014 --> 00:32:23,127
Next train. Three stops.
I'll call you at 9:00.

553
00:32:23,850 --> 00:32:26,043
You better. Thank you.

554
00:33:21,679 --> 00:33:23,142
_

555
00:33:23,317 --> 00:33:25,974
_

556
00:33:26,823 --> 00:33:29,309
_

557
00:33:29,531 --> 00:33:31,591
_

558
00:33:32,495 --> 00:33:36,295
_

559
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:38,639
_

560
00:34:10,238 --> 00:34:12,555
- Wow, wow, wow.
- Hi.

561
00:34:12,950 --> 00:34:15,072
You look crazy.

562
00:34:15,183 --> 00:34:17,330
- Thank you.
- Sit, sit, sit. Please sit.

563
00:34:17,355 --> 00:34:20,104
Listen, I am going to be
very up front here, Jin.

564
00:34:20,157 --> 00:34:22,344
- I don't want...
- I have a lovely Chablis.

565
00:34:23,151 --> 00:34:24,416
Thank you.

566
00:34:25,442 --> 00:34:27,737
Gorgeous, gorgeous.

567
00:34:28,135 --> 00:34:33,605
I also got you a little,
tiny, lovely gift.

568
00:34:35,321 --> 00:34:36,587
Um...

569
00:34:37,073 --> 00:34:39,512
Why did you want to see me, Jin?
What do you know?

570
00:34:40,042 --> 00:34:41,155
Okay.

571
00:34:41,645 --> 00:34:45,278
This information might
make you, uh, uncomfortable.

572
00:34:45,921 --> 00:34:50,187
You have a bit of tissue
stuck under your armpit.

573
00:34:54,775 --> 00:34:56,681
Come on, that was funny!

574
00:34:57,895 --> 00:35:00,295
Did you think I was gonna
give you everything

575
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:02,122
before a proper glass of wine?

576
00:35:14,048 --> 00:35:15,105
Hey!

577
00:35:21,495 --> 00:35:22,762
Come on!

578
00:35:32,431 --> 00:35:33,631
Try some!

579
00:35:33,689 --> 00:35:34,795
Take it, go on!

580
00:35:35,906 --> 00:35:39,141
God. Do you actually have
any more information for me?

581
00:35:39,275 --> 00:35:41,666
I'm not here to entertain you,
I have a lot of work to do,

582
00:35:41,691 --> 00:35:42,906
I'm not wearing a bra

583
00:35:42,931 --> 00:35:44,401
and frankly, I just want to go home.

584
00:35:44,556 --> 00:35:46,155
Are you flirting with me?

585
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:47,977
Oh.

586
00:35:48,278 --> 00:35:49,421
Oh, thank God. I have to get this.

587
00:35:49,446 --> 00:35:51,987
Okay, okay, don't... don't.
Okay, sorry, sorry. Jeez.

588
00:35:52,012 --> 00:35:53,780
I was just playing, okay?

589
00:35:56,385 --> 00:35:58,628
Okay. You guessed right,

590
00:35:59,289 --> 00:36:02,989
my government fiddled
with the facts, because sex.

591
00:36:03,305 --> 00:36:05,205
But I guarantee, we didn't do it.

592
00:36:05,510 --> 00:36:08,511
And unless I really want to
piss off my superiors,

593
00:36:08,536 --> 00:36:10,251
I can't take this much further.

594
00:36:11,002 --> 00:36:12,782
You, on the other hand...

595
00:36:14,027 --> 00:36:17,628
What I tell you, you never repeat, okay?

596
00:36:21,554 --> 00:36:23,043
I may have gone as crazy as you,

597
00:36:23,068 --> 00:36:25,339
but I think a girl was
trailing you at the U-Bahn.

598
00:36:25,364 --> 00:36:27,777
I'm now following her.
Call Weber, will you?

599
00:36:27,802 --> 00:36:30,274
I'm on her tail, we are
moving through Cassiopeia.

600
00:36:30,389 --> 00:36:32,417
Call me. I don't want
to lose eyes on her.

601
00:36:40,874 --> 00:36:42,191
_

602
00:36:42,216 --> 00:36:43,644
Stop.

603
00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:11,483
Last week, Fat Panda hacked
into the account of an agent

604
00:37:11,508 --> 00:37:12,991
of the Chinese Intelligence.

605
00:37:13,079 --> 00:37:15,488
An organization has been
paying him millions.

606
00:37:15,513 --> 00:37:17,413
We don't know what for,
but a week later,

607
00:37:17,438 --> 00:37:19,546
both Fat Panda and the agent were dead.

608
00:37:19,919 --> 00:37:21,252
Okay.

609
00:37:25,715 --> 00:37:26,729
What is that?

610
00:37:26,754 --> 00:37:30,136
You might have
a little creature yourself.

611
00:37:30,873 --> 00:37:35,468
Think of this as a friendly,
little mole trap.

612
00:37:39,839 --> 00:37:42,101
I'm in a club called Funkeln.

613
00:37:42,224 --> 00:37:44,358
She's here somewhere, but I've lost her.

614
00:37:47,230 --> 00:37:48,590
Excuse me one second.

615
00:37:50,118 --> 00:37:51,763
Do you like chocolate mousse?

616
00:37:53,148 --> 00:37:54,477
H-Hold on, Jin.

617
00:37:57,627 --> 00:37:59,469
Thank you, thank you, but I have to go.

618
00:37:59,494 --> 00:38:01,781
Hey! You break my heart!

619
00:38:01,901 --> 00:38:03,968
Let me know if you change
your mind about the sauna.

620
00:38:04,232 --> 00:38:05,650
Uh-huh.

621
00:38:45,044 --> 00:38:50,140
_

622
00:38:50,165 --> 00:38:51,952
Emergency. Let me in, please.

623
00:40:10,363 --> 00:40:11,896
Scheisse.

624
00:40:14,848 --> 00:40:16,110
Hey, hey!

625
00:40:25,393 --> 00:40:27,293
No! No! Aah! Aah!

626
00:40:45,512 --> 00:40:46,669
Bill!

627
00:40:50,023 --> 00:40:51,355
Bill?

628
00:40:54,628 --> 00:40:55,997
No! No!

629
00:40:56,085 --> 00:40:57,203
No!

630
00:40:59,897 --> 00:41:01,095
Bill! No!

631
00:41:01,828 --> 00:41:03,543
No, no, no! No!

632
00:41:07,359 --> 00:41:08,642
Bill!

633
00:41:12,848 --> 00:41:14,003
Bill!
