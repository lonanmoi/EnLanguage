1
00:02:07,643 --> 00:02:09,428
Eve! Eve! Eve!

2
00:02:09,972 --> 00:02:11,867
- Ohhhhh!
- Darling, what is it?

3
00:02:11,892 --> 00:02:12,965
I can't!

4
00:02:13,156 --> 00:02:14,500
Oh, my God, darling! Wake up, it's okay.

5
00:02:14,501 --> 00:02:17,603
It's okay! I-I...

6
00:02:17,604 --> 00:02:20,457
Baby! It's okay. Wake up, wake up!

7
00:02:20,648 --> 00:02:22,633
What was it? Was it... Was it...

8
00:02:24,908 --> 00:02:26,828
I fell asleep on both my arms.

9
00:02:27,848 --> 00:02:28,889
Oh.

10
00:02:29,078 --> 00:02:30,345
Oh, they're coming back now.

11
00:02:31,278 --> 00:02:33,761
Mnh. Oh.

12
00:02:34,321 --> 00:02:35,654
Jesus, my heart.

13
00:02:35,889 --> 00:02:37,079
You freak.

14
00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:41,827
- I'm sorry, it was scary.
- Yeah. It was.

15
00:02:44,062 --> 00:02:47,454
Ohh, Jesus! My head.

16
00:02:47,838 --> 00:02:48,971
Ugh.

17
00:02:49,369 --> 00:02:51,003
What time did we leave last night?

18
00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:53,939
It all ended when you and Bill
sang "A Whole New World."

19
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:56,255
Oh, yeah.

20
00:02:56,501 --> 00:02:58,149
No one could follow that.

21
00:03:00,792 --> 00:03:02,748
Well, at least we have
the whole weekend to reco...

22
00:03:02,844 --> 00:03:04,145
Ugh.

23
00:03:06,093 --> 00:03:08,654
- Oh. Oh, my God.
- Happy Saturday.

24
00:03:08,655 --> 00:03:10,963
- You were superb last night.
- Thank you.

25
00:03:11,622 --> 00:03:12,792
What's going on?

26
00:03:13,154 --> 00:03:14,693
Oh, did you get me a croissant?

27
00:03:14,816 --> 00:03:16,462
No. Do you want the rest of this?

28
00:03:16,463 --> 00:03:17,730
Of course I want the rest of that.

29
00:03:17,731 --> 00:03:19,274
Mmm!

30
00:03:19,386 --> 00:03:21,642
How are you so perky?
You left after I did.

31
00:03:21,785 --> 00:03:24,303
I went for a run this morning,
then I ate some coal.

32
00:03:24,304 --> 00:03:26,123
Apparently it's a thing. I feel great.

33
00:03:26,686 --> 00:03:28,640
Okay, from what I can eavesdrop on,

34
00:03:28,759 --> 00:03:31,556
a Russian sex-trafficking politician's
been murdered in Vienna.

35
00:03:31,581 --> 00:03:33,279
- Oh, no.
- I know, bum-out.

36
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,300
Why are they crying about it here?
Don't know.

37
00:03:35,546 --> 00:03:37,414
- Was it a contract kill?
- I don't know.

38
00:03:37,755 --> 00:03:39,305
You really earn your money, you know?

39
00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:42,051
- I have no idea what we do here.
- Get me a croissant.

40
00:03:45,812 --> 00:03:47,927
Right. Everyone's in there with Frank.

41
00:03:48,077 --> 00:03:50,425
- God.
- And oh, Lord.

42
00:03:50,450 --> 00:03:52,102
- It's Carolyn Martens.
- Who?

43
00:03:52,475 --> 00:03:54,033
MI6. Russia desk.

44
00:03:54,034 --> 00:03:56,448
Ugh, I'd nail a cousin
to work with that woman.

45
00:03:56,567 --> 00:03:58,784
- Stone-cold badass.
- I'll put in a good word.

46
00:03:58,809 --> 00:04:00,763
No, please don't. You're the late one.

47
00:04:10,153 --> 00:04:11,439
Professional.

48
00:04:12,568 --> 00:04:13,735
Where did you get that?

49
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:16,325
Okay. Well, thank you all
for giving us your Saturday.

50
00:04:18,114 --> 00:04:19,959
Turns out people
are still murderous bastards

51
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:21,627
on the weekend.

52
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,566
This is Carolyn Martens,
head of the Russian desk.

53
00:04:27,926 --> 00:04:30,069
- You've met Bill Pargrave.
- Hi.

54
00:04:30,293 --> 00:04:32,176
And his late assistant.

55
00:04:33,239 --> 00:04:34,974
Eve Polastri. My apologies...

56
00:04:34,975 --> 00:04:37,118
They assess and provide
diplomatic protection

57
00:04:37,143 --> 00:04:39,511
for visitors to the UK
and will be your liaison.

58
00:04:40,383 --> 00:04:42,910
It was Bill's birthday party last night.

59
00:04:43,635 --> 00:04:45,345
They don't normally look this sweaty.

60
00:04:45,634 --> 00:04:47,820
It was just a spontaneous thing.

61
00:04:48,555 --> 00:04:49,725
Mm-hmm.

62
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:51,290
Good morning.

63
00:04:55,765 --> 00:04:57,687
There's been an assassination in Vienna.

64
00:04:58,365 --> 00:05:00,266
Victor Kedrin was a Russian politician

65
00:05:00,267 --> 00:05:02,049
visiting Austria last week.

66
00:05:02,590 --> 00:05:03,771
He was not a popular man.

67
00:05:03,796 --> 00:05:05,813
But he had an unfortunately
high profile.

68
00:05:05,877 --> 00:05:07,973
Yesterday, Kedrin was coming out of

69
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:10,016
an exceptionally good,
by the way, sushi restaurant

70
00:05:10,041 --> 00:05:12,862
near Stephansplatz with his
girlfriend, Kasia Molkovska.

71
00:05:14,482 --> 00:05:16,573
Somehow, about 50 yards
from the restaurant,

72
00:05:16,795 --> 00:05:19,652
the assassin managed to slice
Kedrin's femoral artery

73
00:05:19,653 --> 00:05:21,720
with a blade without him
or his girlfriend noticing.

74
00:05:21,721 --> 00:05:24,604
He was bleeding for about
a minute before he collapsed.

75
00:05:24,763 --> 00:05:25,937
Cool.

76
00:05:29,629 --> 00:05:33,502
His girlfriend is the only
witness, but she fled the scene.

77
00:05:33,728 --> 00:05:35,720
Interpol traced her here to the UK.

78
00:05:35,767 --> 00:05:38,144
She was picked up
in Hammersmith this morning

79
00:05:38,326 --> 00:05:39,838
and needs protection.

80
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:42,341
- 20 quid it was a woman.
- Sorry?

81
00:05:43,163 --> 00:05:44,562
Sorry. Nothing.

82
00:05:46,238 --> 00:05:48,057
We'll be sure to sort it.

83
00:05:48,082 --> 00:05:50,116
Was there any CCTV of the killer?

84
00:05:50,823 --> 00:05:54,048
No. No, as far as we know,
it was just a blind spot.

85
00:05:56,076 --> 00:05:58,991
Thank you for your... time.

86
00:05:59,325 --> 00:06:02,304
I imagine the girl is, erm,
quite traumatized.

87
00:06:02,424 --> 00:06:03,791
She's the only witness.

88
00:06:05,131 --> 00:06:06,664
Surround her with humans, will you?

89
00:06:11,965 --> 00:06:13,386
I said it was probably a woman.

90
00:06:14,451 --> 00:06:16,937
Victor Kedrin was a misogynist
and a sex trafficker.

91
00:06:16,962 --> 00:06:19,591
He may not have considered
a passing woman a threat.

92
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:23,507
She must have been able to get close.

93
00:06:24,423 --> 00:06:26,821
Thank you. Thank you, Eve.

94
00:06:28,547 --> 00:06:29,581
Ohh.

95
00:06:29,928 --> 00:06:31,490
She said, "Eve."

96
00:06:31,491 --> 00:06:33,039
Congratulations.

97
00:06:36,721 --> 00:06:38,760
Give me the rest of that,
or I'll fire you.

98
00:06:42,346 --> 00:06:43,855
I want to meet that witness.

99
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:46,005
- If I'm right, then...
- No. Not your job.

100
00:06:46,547 --> 00:06:48,979
Get her secure and get her some clothes.

101
00:06:49,976 --> 00:06:53,142
Please don't make this a thing.
I'm feeling very fragile.

102
00:06:53,341 --> 00:06:54,680
I'm telling you, it's a woman.

103
00:06:55,193 --> 00:06:56,415
Happy birthday, Bill.

104
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:58,973
It was just a bit of karaoke, Frank.

105
00:07:57,354 --> 00:07:58,557
Ohh.

106
00:08:12,759 --> 00:08:14,007
Oh.

107
00:08:17,090 --> 00:08:18,330
Ohh!

108
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:28,370
Mm.

109
00:08:47,488 --> 00:08:48,500
Merci, Lulu.

110
00:09:24,824 --> 00:09:25,982
Wow.

111
00:09:28,828 --> 00:09:30,002
Beautiful.

112
00:10:34,185 --> 00:10:35,394
Villanelle?

113
00:10:42,976 --> 00:10:44,128
Villanelle.

114
00:10:46,095 --> 00:10:47,639
I can see you breathing.

115
00:10:50,817 --> 00:10:52,192
- Meerh!
- Argh!

116
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:54,887
Oy!

117
00:10:54,888 --> 00:10:56,387
- I got you!
- Yes.

118
00:10:56,412 --> 00:10:59,254
- A bit, admit it. A tiny bit.
- A tiny bit, yes.

119
00:10:59,326 --> 00:11:01,126
- Were you scared?
- No.

120
00:11:01,127 --> 00:11:03,161
- Did you think I was dead?
- No.

121
00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:05,985
- Would you be sad?
- Of course.

122
00:11:06,644 --> 00:11:09,314
Oh! Your face.

123
00:11:10,028 --> 00:11:11,195
I got you.

124
00:11:12,072 --> 00:11:13,294
How was Vienna?

125
00:11:13,397 --> 00:11:15,169
Good. Mm. Quick.

126
00:11:16,743 --> 00:11:18,786
- But I'm tired.
- Of course.

127
00:11:19,174 --> 00:11:21,113
Do you want to stay and watch a movie?

128
00:11:21,398 --> 00:11:23,648
- No, I can't. I'm sorry.
- "No, I can't. I'm sorry."

129
00:11:26,098 --> 00:11:27,929
They want me to give you this.

130
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:32,132
- Bonus?
- Yes.

131
00:11:32,347 --> 00:11:34,159
Because I'm sensational.

132
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,849
Oh, yes. Of course.

133
00:11:36,494 --> 00:11:38,462
And they want you to do another job.

134
00:11:39,029 --> 00:11:40,032
When?

135
00:11:40,033 --> 00:11:42,031
We know it's a tight turnaround.

136
00:11:42,056 --> 00:11:43,245
Tomorrow.

137
00:11:44,164 --> 00:11:46,772
- All information is on there.
- Sure.

138
00:11:46,886 --> 00:11:49,107
Tuscany will be beautiful right now.

139
00:11:49,246 --> 00:11:51,223
- You want to come?
- No.

140
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:53,186
Well, can I take someone else?

141
00:11:54,761 --> 00:11:56,673
I just want someone to play with.

142
00:11:57,459 --> 00:11:58,931
You play in Tuscany.

143
00:11:59,146 --> 00:12:01,514
And we will watch a movie
when you come back.

144
00:12:01,791 --> 00:12:03,491
- You don't mean that.
- "You don't mean that."

145
00:12:03,516 --> 00:12:04,616
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

146
00:12:28,448 --> 00:12:29,678
Aw.

147
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:32,610
Nice face.

148
00:12:52,082 --> 00:12:55,196
That looks terrifying. Does it burn?

149
00:12:55,299 --> 00:12:57,581
No, it just strips your stomach
so you can't feel anything.

150
00:12:57,606 --> 00:13:02,014
Oh, cool. Okay, so,
her name is Kasia Molkovska.

151
00:13:02,172 --> 00:13:04,793
And we'll need two officers
on each shift.

152
00:13:05,554 --> 00:13:06,715
Mm.

153
00:13:07,104 --> 00:13:08,622
Oh, Jesus. That's gross.

154
00:13:09,106 --> 00:13:10,481
Where do they want her overnight?

155
00:13:10,576 --> 00:13:11,810
Uh, don't know.

156
00:13:11,836 --> 00:13:13,483
They haven't transferred her
from the station yet.

157
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:16,010
- Really? Hammersmith?
- Mm-hmm.

158
00:13:17,188 --> 00:13:18,395
So she's still there?

159
00:13:18,895 --> 00:13:20,581
Yeah. Apparently,
she's a bit of a character.

160
00:13:21,324 --> 00:13:22,518
Okay, um...

161
00:13:23,355 --> 00:13:25,491
You know, I'm gonna... I'm gonna
pop down there quickly.

162
00:13:26,370 --> 00:13:27,637
Why?

163
00:13:28,017 --> 00:13:29,032
No reason.

164
00:13:29,057 --> 00:13:32,109
Just get those officers assigned
to her, and I'll sign off.

165
00:13:32,315 --> 00:13:33,887
Did we sing Disney?

166
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:35,514
- Yes.
- Yeah.

167
00:13:35,515 --> 00:13:36,582
Damn.

168
00:13:38,941 --> 00:13:40,084
Where are you going?

169
00:13:40,794 --> 00:13:41,987
To the bathroom.

170
00:13:41,988 --> 00:13:43,722
- Done the report?
- Mm-hmm.

171
00:13:43,923 --> 00:13:45,693
Okay. Good work.

172
00:13:46,662 --> 00:13:48,730
Now... cough up.

173
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:50,547
- What?
- 20 quid.

174
00:13:51,142 --> 00:13:53,899
CCTV from Vienna turned up.
It was a bloke.

175
00:13:53,997 --> 00:13:55,696
What? What? Since the meeting?

176
00:13:55,721 --> 00:13:58,103
- Yeah. Frank just said.
- No, he said there wasn't...

177
00:13:58,104 --> 00:14:00,138
- 20 quid.
- Have you seen it?

178
00:14:00,139 --> 00:14:01,519
- Of course not.
- Why not?

179
00:14:01,544 --> 00:14:02,844
Stop it!

180
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:05,319
There's a difference
between thinking it was a woman

181
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:07,805
- and wanting it to be a woman.
- Who's a woman?

182
00:14:10,427 --> 00:14:12,167
You'll get the rest when I see the tape.

183
00:14:12,219 --> 00:14:13,994
I'm going to try to throw up.

184
00:14:14,618 --> 00:14:16,263
I suggest you do, too.

185
00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:19,346
I wanna see that CCTV.

186
00:14:20,278 --> 00:14:21,643
What was that all about?

187
00:14:21,818 --> 00:14:22,953
Nothing.

188
00:14:24,651 --> 00:14:26,152
I'm going to the station.

189
00:14:26,292 --> 00:14:28,833
- Why?
- Just don't tell Bill.

190
00:14:29,359 --> 00:14:32,140
You're the best. I love you.
You're amazing. Goodbye.

191
00:14:33,037 --> 00:14:34,211
Bye.

192
00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:38,502
Ciemno bylo...

193
00:14:39,749 --> 00:14:41,195
Nie wiem...

194
00:14:45,425 --> 00:14:47,018
Wy swinie...

195
00:14:47,019 --> 00:14:48,887
Nie mozna wam wierzyc...

196
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:51,246
Wszyscy jestescie chujami...

197
00:14:52,178 --> 00:14:53,860
I'm sorry. She's unintelligible.

198
00:14:53,885 --> 00:14:55,068
She's mainly swearing.

199
00:14:55,093 --> 00:14:56,760
Oh, that's okay.
She's had a hell of a night.

200
00:14:56,785 --> 00:14:58,929
I-I just need to know
if she's aware of anyone

201
00:14:58,954 --> 00:15:01,145
who might wanna harm her
while she's in the country.

202
00:15:01,170 --> 00:15:03,371
Czy myslisz,
ze cos Ci grozi w tym kraju,

203
00:15:03,396 --> 00:15:05,212
ktos chce Cie skrzywdzic?

204
00:15:09,186 --> 00:15:11,372
Poor thing. Can someone get her a tea?

205
00:15:11,467 --> 00:15:13,847
Max?

206
00:15:18,906 --> 00:15:20,127
Has she mentioned Vienna

207
00:15:20,152 --> 00:15:21,853
or anything about
her boyfriend's killer?

208
00:15:22,955 --> 00:15:24,823
I think she's saying
that they were drunk

209
00:15:24,824 --> 00:15:26,013
or she's drunk now.

210
00:15:26,324 --> 00:15:28,359
She mentioned a plank of wood.

211
00:15:28,763 --> 00:15:31,530
Was it tall or... dark?

212
00:15:31,726 --> 00:15:33,565
God, I'm sorry.

213
00:15:33,566 --> 00:15:35,285
Ask her if it was a man or a woman?

214
00:15:35,349 --> 00:15:38,303
To byl mezczyzna czy kobieta?

215
00:15:39,672 --> 00:15:41,173
Ale decha.

216
00:15:41,174 --> 00:15:42,440
Psycholka...

217
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:44,581
Do piet mi nie dorasta.

218
00:15:45,081 --> 00:15:47,846
Does anyone in the department
speak heroin Polish?

219
00:15:48,045 --> 00:15:49,323
No, I mean, I'm serious.

220
00:15:52,059 --> 00:15:55,475
You know, uh, Max, we need
to get her to a facility.

221
00:15:56,355 --> 00:15:57,570
Thanks.

222
00:15:57,595 --> 00:15:59,160
Rusz dupe i do l�zka!

223
00:15:59,185 --> 00:16:03,061
- Oh, you speak Polish?
- Uh, no. My husband is Polish.

224
00:16:03,062 --> 00:16:04,196
Oh, you know, I've just picked up

225
00:16:04,197 --> 00:16:05,297
a... a couple of phrases.

226
00:16:05,298 --> 00:16:06,382
Thanks, Max.

227
00:16:07,028 --> 00:16:08,171
What did she say?

228
00:16:08,894 --> 00:16:10,498
"Get your arse into bed."

229
00:16:25,668 --> 00:16:26,942
- Sorry.
- Oh.

230
00:16:33,873 --> 00:16:35,760
- I wasn't flirting.
- Hmm.

231
00:16:35,812 --> 00:16:36,986
How are you?

232
00:16:38,513 --> 00:16:40,539
Oh, I thought you'd be straight to bed.

233
00:16:40,571 --> 00:16:42,485
Oh, I'm soldiering through.

234
00:16:43,112 --> 00:16:44,367
It's a great turn-out.

235
00:16:44,937 --> 00:16:48,006
Yeah. Bunch of animals!

236
00:16:48,276 --> 00:16:49,373
Wanna play?

237
00:16:49,398 --> 00:16:51,327
Oh, with a gin and tonic, definitely.

238
00:16:51,883 --> 00:16:54,379
Uh, I need to steal Dom for a minute.

239
00:16:54,547 --> 00:16:55,888
- Dom?
- Mm-hmm.

240
00:16:56,347 --> 00:16:57,658
Should I be jealous?

241
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:00,415
Always be jealous.

242
00:17:01,267 --> 00:17:02,921
- I need you, too.
- Don't worry.

243
00:17:02,922 --> 00:17:04,756
Right, I'll get him.

244
00:17:08,106 --> 00:17:10,371
- Whoa, she's flying.
- Yeah.

245
00:17:10,396 --> 00:17:12,650
The translator couldn't get
anything clear out of her.

246
00:17:12,675 --> 00:17:15,169
You recognize anything, Dom?
It might be teenage Polish.

247
00:17:15,288 --> 00:17:17,569
- What do you need?
- Uh, just the description of

248
00:17:17,570 --> 00:17:19,571
the person she saw
while she was on the street.

249
00:17:19,691 --> 00:17:23,011
Here she goes. Tall. Dark.

250
00:17:25,278 --> 00:17:29,748
If I say to you, "ale decha,"
what does that mean?

251
00:17:29,844 --> 00:17:31,497
Um. What?

252
00:17:31,522 --> 00:17:33,443
What do you think? Ale decha?

253
00:17:33,819 --> 00:17:35,253
I don't wanna comment, but...

254
00:17:35,765 --> 00:17:37,889
I mean, they're lovely, but...

255
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:41,262
- Say it.
- "Ale decha" is... small breasts.

256
00:17:41,287 --> 00:17:44,035
- Flat-chested. Like a plank.
- Oh, my God!

257
00:17:44,241 --> 00:17:46,035
See, this kid is using slang

258
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:47,689
your Ethel wouldn't be familiar with.

259
00:17:48,356 --> 00:17:51,980
Your killer was a...
"a small-breasted psycho,"

260
00:17:52,005 --> 00:17:53,171
apparently.

261
00:17:58,098 --> 00:17:59,534
Excellent translating work.

262
00:18:03,064 --> 00:18:05,056
Hey. Uh. Hi.

263
00:18:05,135 --> 00:18:07,041
I was counting on you not having a life.

264
00:18:07,105 --> 00:18:08,964
Uh, wait, why are you
still at the office?

265
00:18:08,989 --> 00:18:11,252
My sister and her arsehole baby
are staying with me

266
00:18:11,277 --> 00:18:13,258
while she goes for interviews.
I get more sleep here.

267
00:18:13,259 --> 00:18:14,526
What do you want from me?

268
00:18:14,527 --> 00:18:17,996
Can you pull Margit Polsen
from the registry

269
00:18:17,997 --> 00:18:21,766
and any other active female
assassins under the age of 45?

270
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:23,590
Okay. Hold on.

271
00:18:24,633 --> 00:18:25,904
I got Margie. Go.

272
00:18:26,118 --> 00:18:28,309
Uh, how big are her tits? Breasts.

273
00:18:29,607 --> 00:18:31,676
Okay. I know you're into assassins,

274
00:18:31,677 --> 00:18:33,345
but I refuse to talk
about them in this way.

275
00:18:33,346 --> 00:18:35,279
- They're people, too, you know?
- Elena!

276
00:18:35,977 --> 00:18:39,851
Massive. She appears to have
massive, pendulous breasts.

277
00:18:39,852 --> 00:18:41,186
Is that doing it for you?

278
00:18:41,728 --> 00:18:44,303
Thank you. Are there any others on file?

279
00:18:44,954 --> 00:18:46,741
There are just two more on record.

280
00:18:46,766 --> 00:18:48,173
I'm just pulling them up.

281
00:18:48,554 --> 00:18:51,430
Um, Katrina Voltrinski
and Wendi Helmsen.

282
00:18:51,908 --> 00:18:53,164
What's this about?

283
00:18:53,165 --> 00:18:54,566
Oh, they're... they're both dead.

284
00:18:54,567 --> 00:18:56,483
Are there any alerts up for new ones?

285
00:18:57,381 --> 00:18:58,503
No.

286
00:18:58,826 --> 00:19:00,573
Okay. Thanks.

287
00:19:01,102 --> 00:19:03,634
Oh, and don't tell anyone
I asked for that.

288
00:19:03,659 --> 00:19:05,110
Of course. All our hotlines

289
00:19:05,111 --> 00:19:06,889
are completely confidential, madam.

290
00:19:07,374 --> 00:19:08,507
Piss off.

291
00:19:08,608 --> 00:19:10,338
- Thank you.
- All right.

292
00:20:33,699 --> 00:20:34,799
Oh...

293
00:22:00,437 --> 00:22:01,700
Nonno!

294
00:22:42,852 --> 00:22:43,854
Ohh.

295
00:22:57,509 --> 00:22:58,858
Nonno!

296
00:24:27,573 --> 00:24:28,918
Argh!

297
00:25:11,922 --> 00:25:13,439
Nonno!

298
00:25:31,275 --> 00:25:32,540
Nonno!

299
00:26:00,283 --> 00:26:01,354
Oh.

300
00:26:03,639 --> 00:26:04,788
Do you want cheese on it?

301
00:26:04,813 --> 00:26:06,107
Uh, no.

302
00:26:06,132 --> 00:26:08,093
Uh, yes. Yes, please.

303
00:26:24,305 --> 00:26:26,182
- Hey.
- Hey.

304
00:26:26,207 --> 00:26:27,695
Ah.

305
00:26:27,787 --> 00:26:29,515
- Jesus.
- Uh-huh.

306
00:26:29,542 --> 00:26:31,983
All that from a tiny puncture.

307
00:26:32,008 --> 00:26:33,358
- It's so awful.
- It's impressive.

308
00:26:33,672 --> 00:26:35,939
And... awful. Yeah.

309
00:26:36,027 --> 00:26:37,043
Dinner?

310
00:26:37,068 --> 00:26:38,609
How would you kill me if you could?

311
00:26:38,823 --> 00:26:42,009
Um, I don't know.
Push you down the stairs?

312
00:26:42,042 --> 00:26:44,410
No, seriously. They'd...
They'd come for you immediately.

313
00:26:45,371 --> 00:26:47,635
I don't know. Flatter you to death.

314
00:26:48,644 --> 00:26:50,559
Okay. How would you kill me?

315
00:26:51,434 --> 00:26:53,107
I'd paralyze you with saxitoxin

316
00:26:53,132 --> 00:26:54,513
and suffocate you in your sleep.

317
00:26:55,464 --> 00:26:57,762
Chop you into the smallest bits
I could manage,

318
00:26:57,940 --> 00:26:59,821
boil you down, put you in a blender,

319
00:27:00,603 --> 00:27:01,858
then take you to work in a flask

320
00:27:01,883 --> 00:27:03,407
and flush you down a restaurant toilet.

321
00:27:05,237 --> 00:27:06,665
You've really thought about that.

322
00:27:07,340 --> 00:27:09,318
- Smart, huh?
- Very.

323
00:27:10,719 --> 00:27:12,638
- Sexy?
- Hugely.

324
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:15,513
- Do you want supper?
- Ooh. Yes. Thank you.

325
00:27:15,538 --> 00:27:17,435
- Okay. Love you.
- Love you.

326
00:27:25,483 --> 00:27:26,692
Bin?

327
00:27:47,730 --> 00:27:49,008
Do you want to have sex?

328
00:27:49,420 --> 00:27:50,558
Sure.

329
00:27:55,422 --> 00:27:56,620
Mm.

330
00:27:57,250 --> 00:27:59,966
You know, someone
is lying about the CCTV.

331
00:28:00,578 --> 00:28:01,728
Bill?

332
00:28:02,482 --> 00:28:03,696
No.

333
00:28:04,499 --> 00:28:05,963
What did he say about the recording?

334
00:28:08,339 --> 00:28:09,546
I didn't tell him.

335
00:28:10,255 --> 00:28:11,470
I need to get more.

336
00:28:11,495 --> 00:28:14,758
And I need her consent to record... her.

337
00:28:15,754 --> 00:28:18,512
- How bad have you been?
- Really bad.

338
00:28:18,726 --> 00:28:19,955
You're in the wrong department.

339
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:21,707
- Yes.
- You should have been a spy.

340
00:28:22,117 --> 00:28:23,721
Exactly. Thank you.

341
00:28:24,223 --> 00:28:25,437
Mm.

342
00:28:31,675 --> 00:28:33,286
Sorry! Sex.

343
00:28:33,564 --> 00:28:34,786
I'm actually knackered.

344
00:28:35,289 --> 00:28:36,963
Oh, good. Okay.

345
00:28:44,966 --> 00:28:46,433
Can I get Dom's number?

346
00:28:48,584 --> 00:28:49,762
What?

347
00:28:55,844 --> 00:28:58,012
Afternoon, everybody.

348
00:28:59,212 --> 00:29:00,298
Mnh.

349
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:03,762
Do you think you could
excuse your guests?

350
00:29:07,114 --> 00:29:08,220
Au revoir.

351
00:29:16,315 --> 00:29:17,634
Three days ago,

352
00:29:17,659 --> 00:29:20,901
one of Moscow's
most controversial politician

353
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:22,907
was found professionally murdered

354
00:29:22,932 --> 00:29:25,277
in a pretty street in Vienna.

355
00:29:27,030 --> 00:29:28,153
Very good.

356
00:29:29,142 --> 00:29:32,244
The murder took place
in a CCTV blind spot.

357
00:29:32,478 --> 00:29:33,653
Also good.

358
00:29:33,709 --> 00:29:35,810
The politician's girlfriend

359
00:29:36,123 --> 00:29:38,483
was reportedly with him while he died.

360
00:29:39,064 --> 00:29:40,255
Fine.

361
00:29:40,398 --> 00:29:41,802
And was not harmed.

362
00:29:42,513 --> 00:29:43,822
Not so good.

363
00:29:44,132 --> 00:29:47,293
She is currently in London,
where she will be interviewed

364
00:29:47,294 --> 00:29:49,534
as a principal witness to the murder.

365
00:29:50,017 --> 00:29:51,153
Bad.

366
00:29:51,832 --> 00:29:53,608
Which will take place tomorrow.

367
00:29:54,033 --> 00:29:55,147
Very bad.

368
00:29:57,938 --> 00:29:59,311
Have you had a haircut?

369
00:30:00,707 --> 00:30:01,897
Yes.

370
00:30:01,934 --> 00:30:03,040
Hmm.

371
00:30:04,620 --> 00:30:06,893
Your train leaves in an hour.

372
00:30:09,182 --> 00:30:10,961
So keep the job tidy, huh?

373
00:30:11,885 --> 00:30:14,425
Your fancy hairpin
is all over the press.

374
00:30:14,450 --> 00:30:16,721
Don't worry. I got another one.

375
00:30:16,990 --> 00:30:18,923
- It's not funny.
- It was a bit.

376
00:30:20,590 --> 00:30:21,790
They won't catch me.

377
00:30:23,659 --> 00:30:25,135
- They might.
- They won't.

378
00:30:25,167 --> 00:30:26,968
- No, listen, they might.
- They won't.

379
00:30:27,607 --> 00:30:29,718
Make it look like suicide.

380
00:30:33,429 --> 00:30:34,652
First class?

381
00:30:35,368 --> 00:30:36,581
Of course.

382
00:30:41,110 --> 00:30:42,745
- Lunch swap?
- Sure.

383
00:30:45,650 --> 00:30:49,263
Oh. Your wife is an artist.

384
00:30:49,482 --> 00:30:51,009
She's a control freak.

385
00:30:53,821 --> 00:30:55,166
Can I eat this cold?

386
00:30:55,277 --> 00:30:57,525
Yeah. Just don't tell Niko.

387
00:30:58,095 --> 00:30:59,279
How is he?

388
00:30:59,365 --> 00:31:00,496
He's really well.

389
00:31:01,868 --> 00:31:03,015
He's really nice.

390
00:31:03,791 --> 00:31:04,914
He's really well.

391
00:31:04,939 --> 00:31:07,249
Okay. Is that what you've been
wanting to talk about?

392
00:31:07,274 --> 00:31:09,382
You've been weirdly casual all morning.

393
00:31:09,407 --> 00:31:11,661
- I don't want to talk about that.
- Spit it out.

394
00:31:12,104 --> 00:31:14,208
You've got as long as this pie lasts.

395
00:31:15,807 --> 00:31:16,950
Okay.

396
00:31:17,484 --> 00:31:19,828
The Kedrin assassin was a woman.

397
00:31:19,853 --> 00:31:21,720
Oh, my God! I interviewed the
witness, and she confirmed it...

398
00:31:21,721 --> 00:31:24,340
I'll give you the 20 quid to shut up.

399
00:31:24,558 --> 00:31:26,271
- There was CCTV.
- No, no, no, no.

400
00:31:26,296 --> 00:31:27,947
See, there wasn't any CCTV

401
00:31:27,972 --> 00:31:30,362
until after I suggested
it might be a woman.

402
00:31:30,363 --> 00:31:32,486
Did you just say
you interviewed the witness?

403
00:31:33,581 --> 00:31:36,311
- Eve! What's happened to you?
- Nothing. Nothing happened.

404
00:31:36,336 --> 00:31:37,670
- You're going mad.
- Nothing ever happens.

405
00:31:37,671 --> 00:31:39,471
And, see, now this woman is happening,

406
00:31:39,595 --> 00:31:42,074
and either someone is
stopping it from coming out

407
00:31:42,075 --> 00:31:44,131
or someone is too lazy to follow it up.

408
00:31:44,496 --> 00:31:46,164
Are you accusing me of something?

409
00:31:46,189 --> 00:31:47,499
I don't know. Maybe.

410
00:31:47,825 --> 00:31:49,615
Yes! Maybe you're being lazy!

411
00:31:49,616 --> 00:31:51,083
And so what if it is a woman, anyway?

412
00:31:51,084 --> 00:31:52,718
I don't care if it was an alien.

413
00:31:52,719 --> 00:31:56,622
Yeah, but she's... she's new,
and she's prolific, Bill.

414
00:31:56,623 --> 00:31:58,257
- Look.
- It's not our job.

415
00:31:58,258 --> 00:31:59,870
I've been compiling
these cases for months.

416
00:31:59,895 --> 00:32:01,624
Tuscany yesterday.

417
00:32:01,856 --> 00:32:03,462
Kasia is the only lead we have,

418
00:32:03,463 --> 00:32:05,384
and, tomorrow morning,
she's someone else's witness.

419
00:32:05,409 --> 00:32:07,433
Yes, and they'll interview her

420
00:32:07,434 --> 00:32:08,849
and find it all out for themselves.

421
00:32:08,874 --> 00:32:10,374
What if they're in on it?

422
00:32:10,399 --> 00:32:11,651
In on what?

423
00:32:13,742 --> 00:32:17,277
I don't know.
I just think... it's weird.

424
00:32:17,302 --> 00:32:20,599
Our job is weird, but it's also boring.

425
00:32:21,392 --> 00:32:24,350
I'm... sorry if your husband
is boring you, too,

426
00:32:24,351 --> 00:32:27,019
but that doesn't give you
an excuse to go rogue at work.

427
00:32:27,020 --> 00:32:29,989
You could get in a lot of
trouble if I was a serious man.

428
00:32:29,990 --> 00:32:31,636
Trouble's not interested in me.

429
00:32:31,730 --> 00:32:32,930
Go to the hospital,

430
00:32:32,955 --> 00:32:35,099
make sure your witness is cozy and safe,

431
00:32:35,124 --> 00:32:38,460
then go home
and don't do anything weird.

432
00:32:45,158 --> 00:32:46,832
It's only two or three questions.

433
00:32:47,018 --> 00:32:48,588
Just say you're her cousin.

434
00:32:50,477 --> 00:32:53,608
I'm with the security team
monitoring Kasia Molkovska.

435
00:32:54,056 --> 00:32:55,247
Last on the left.

436
00:32:55,272 --> 00:32:57,033
Ask for Nurse Watkins.

437
00:32:57,058 --> 00:32:59,543
You can't miss her.
She's in the "fun" scrubs.

438
00:33:02,998 --> 00:33:04,091
Eve Polastri.

439
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:08,227
Hi. Is Kasia awake?

440
00:33:08,228 --> 00:33:09,810
Uh, she's not fit
for interview, I'm afraid.

441
00:33:09,835 --> 00:33:12,640
Oh, no. I know.
This is a relative of Kasia's.

442
00:33:12,885 --> 00:33:14,649
He just wanted to say hi quickly.

443
00:33:14,674 --> 00:33:16,658
Oh, lovely. Okay, uh, just take a seat.

444
00:33:16,683 --> 00:33:17,836
I'll let you know when she's ready.

445
00:33:17,861 --> 00:33:19,058
Great. Thank you.

446
00:33:23,836 --> 00:33:26,528
- Is this legal?
- It's fine.

447
00:33:27,042 --> 00:33:29,108
Wait here a sec.
I'm just gonna pop to the loo.

448
00:33:30,583 --> 00:33:32,525
We should have brought her
some chocolate or something.

449
00:33:35,673 --> 00:33:36,986
I'll see what I can find.

450
00:34:11,312 --> 00:34:12,567
Are you all right?

451
00:34:24,682 --> 00:34:25,789
Wear it down.

452
00:34:44,391 --> 00:34:46,082
- Hi.
- Where are you?

453
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:47,680
On the loo.

454
00:34:47,808 --> 00:34:49,335
There was no CCTV.

455
00:34:49,829 --> 00:34:50,820
What?

456
00:34:50,845 --> 00:34:53,183
It's annoying me, but you were right.

457
00:34:55,506 --> 00:34:57,160
We've been bullshat.

458
00:34:57,612 --> 00:34:59,605
Keep that girl safe.

459
00:35:21,453 --> 00:35:22,557
Dom?

460
00:35:23,848 --> 00:35:25,020
Oh, my God!

461
00:35:25,838 --> 00:35:27,896
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

462
00:35:27,983 --> 00:35:30,025
Oh, Jesus! Dom?!

463
00:35:30,703 --> 00:35:31,670
Dom?!

464
00:35:31,695 --> 00:35:33,655
Oh, my God, Kasia! Oh, God, God, Kasia!

465
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:35,574
Oh, my God! Oh, Kasia. Oh, Kasia.

466
00:35:35,575 --> 00:35:37,275
Please. Please, stay with me.

467
00:35:37,505 --> 00:35:40,268
Somebody help me! Oh, my God!

468
00:35:40,293 --> 00:35:41,736
Somebody help me!

469
00:35:41,761 --> 00:35:43,595
Kasia, stay with me.

470
00:35:43,620 --> 00:35:45,940
Stay with me. No, no.

471
00:35:46,847 --> 00:35:48,863
Bedzie dobrze.

472
00:35:51,192 --> 00:35:53,232
Bedzie dobrze.

473
00:35:53,766 --> 00:35:57,129
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

474
00:35:57,604 --> 00:36:00,225
Oh! Somebody help me!

475
00:36:02,462 --> 00:36:03,771
Oh!

476
00:36:14,427 --> 00:36:17,015
If they fire you, you'd better
drag me down with you.

477
00:36:17,016 --> 00:36:18,984
- No, you're not doing that.
- I am.

478
00:36:18,985 --> 00:36:20,519
I've been looking for an excuse

479
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:22,621
to call Frank a dick-swab for years.

480
00:36:22,646 --> 00:36:24,060
I'm the dick-swab.

481
00:36:26,183 --> 00:36:27,993
I should have requested more security.

482
00:36:27,994 --> 00:36:31,519
You had two armed officers.
You did the right thing.

483
00:36:36,002 --> 00:36:37,200
You're brilliant.

484
00:36:38,616 --> 00:36:40,105
Just don't tell them everything.

485
00:36:40,106 --> 00:36:41,721
You'll sound like a nutter.

486
00:36:45,008 --> 00:36:46,008
Right.

487
00:36:46,869 --> 00:36:48,247
The boy's parents are here.

488
00:36:49,478 --> 00:36:51,699
Apparently, they thought
he was playing bridge.

489
00:36:56,561 --> 00:36:57,942
Have you made your statement?

490
00:36:58,307 --> 00:36:59,317
Mm.

491
00:37:00,414 --> 00:37:01,406
Well...

492
00:37:02,428 --> 00:37:03,989
that one could have gone better.

493
00:37:06,303 --> 00:37:07,900
I don't want to say
you only had one job...

494
00:37:07,901 --> 00:37:09,543
Oh, piss off, Frank.

495
00:37:12,939 --> 00:37:14,608
I don't think you should
speak to me like that

496
00:37:14,633 --> 00:37:15,851
right now, Eve.

497
00:37:17,054 --> 00:37:18,664
Can you... Can you just tell me

498
00:37:18,689 --> 00:37:19,921
what I need to do?

499
00:37:24,853 --> 00:37:26,460
From what I've managed to gather,

500
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:29,296
you have conducted
an illegal investigation.

501
00:37:29,860 --> 00:37:34,026
You've manipulated a witness.
You've put a minor in danger.

502
00:37:34,027 --> 00:37:35,494
- Oh, please.
- And on top...

503
00:37:35,495 --> 00:37:36,803
Don't interrupt me, Bill.

504
00:37:38,021 --> 00:37:40,807
On top of that,
you failed at your actual job,

505
00:37:41,874 --> 00:37:43,402
no doubt because you were so busy

506
00:37:43,403 --> 00:37:45,185
executing your pretend job,

507
00:37:45,626 --> 00:37:48,371
which I believe
was going to earn you 20 quid.

508
00:37:49,576 --> 00:37:50,943
And which you both seem to think

509
00:37:50,944 --> 00:37:52,744
is the most important thing
about this case.

510
00:37:52,745 --> 00:37:53,879
No. The most important thing

511
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:55,180
is that I was right about the fact...

512
00:37:55,181 --> 00:37:57,032
No. No, the most important thing, Eve,

513
00:37:57,057 --> 00:37:59,927
is that four people are dead,
and it's all your fault!

514
00:38:13,616 --> 00:38:15,143
What were you right about?

515
00:38:19,873 --> 00:38:23,041
Kasia described the killer
as "ale decha,"

516
00:38:23,427 --> 00:38:24,929
which means flat-chested.

517
00:38:25,127 --> 00:38:26,345
- No one would ever...
- How do you know that?

518
00:38:26,346 --> 00:38:28,214
Because I secretly recorded
the interview

519
00:38:28,239 --> 00:38:30,549
and brought it home
and asked Dom and my husband

520
00:38:30,550 --> 00:38:31,891
to translate it for me!

521
00:38:35,850 --> 00:38:37,759
- You're fired.
- You're a dick-swab.

522
00:38:38,108 --> 00:38:39,153
- Oi!
- Sorry.

523
00:38:39,277 --> 00:38:40,221
Thank you, Bill.

524
00:38:40,246 --> 00:38:42,754
No, I was gonna call you a dick-swab.

525
00:38:46,952 --> 00:38:49,653
Clearly there's going to be some
reshuffling in your department.

526
00:38:52,105 --> 00:38:54,379
I suggest you both leave, immediately.

527
00:38:55,029 --> 00:38:56,553
Your things will be biked to you.

528
00:39:02,204 --> 00:39:03,938
- Just to be clear, Frank...
- You're fired.

529
00:39:04,003 --> 00:39:05,341
Excellent. Thank you.

530
00:39:27,334 --> 00:39:28,572
Eve.

531
00:39:28,941 --> 00:39:30,042
H-Hi.

532
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:34,182
Is there... anything you need
at the shop?

533
00:39:35,349 --> 00:39:36,481
What?

534
00:39:36,930 --> 00:39:38,067
Milk or...

535
00:39:38,785 --> 00:39:39,851
Uh...

536
00:39:43,264 --> 00:39:44,375
Married?

537
00:39:44,656 --> 00:39:45,716
Yes.

538
00:39:47,170 --> 00:39:48,192
You?

539
00:39:50,156 --> 00:39:51,548
A few times, yes.

540
00:39:55,671 --> 00:40:00,005
Uh, it's really nice of you
to come and... whatever this is.

541
00:40:00,006 --> 00:40:02,060
Um, do you... do you want milk?

542
00:40:02,375 --> 00:40:04,076
We think she's been operating

543
00:40:04,077 --> 00:40:06,192
for 2 years across 10 countries.

544
00:40:07,366 --> 00:40:09,735
She's highly skilled,
as yet untraceable,

545
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:12,443
and, frankly,
she's starting to show off.

546
00:40:14,330 --> 00:40:16,011
When you're feeling perkier...

547
00:40:16,955 --> 00:40:18,590
I'd like to buy you breakfast

548
00:40:18,591 --> 00:40:20,025
at the Purple Penguin restaurant

549
00:40:20,026 --> 00:40:21,150
by Charing Cross.

550
00:40:21,175 --> 00:40:23,443
Thursday. 9:00 a.m.

551
00:40:23,559 --> 00:40:25,026
I'll wait for 10 minutes.

552
00:40:28,664 --> 00:40:30,364
Right. Buy some milk.

553
00:40:30,636 --> 00:40:31,733
Oh. Oh.

554
00:40:31,838 --> 00:40:33,553
Or he'll think you're having an affair.

555
00:40:33,877 --> 00:40:36,278
Oh, no, I don't think
he'd ever think that.

556
00:40:36,303 --> 00:40:37,772
They all think we're having affairs

557
00:40:37,797 --> 00:40:39,377
before they think we're secret agents.

558
00:40:39,441 --> 00:40:41,720
Oh, no, I think Niko
would assume I was an agent

559
00:40:41,745 --> 00:40:44,353
before ever thinking that
I was having an affair.

560
00:40:44,670 --> 00:40:45,871
You might want to make him think

561
00:40:45,896 --> 00:40:47,196
you're having an affair, then.

562
00:40:48,585 --> 00:40:49,839
Hope to see you Thursday.
