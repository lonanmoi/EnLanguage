1
00:00:00,101 --> 00:00:01,858
- Go back to London.
- Are we leaving?

2
00:00:01,883 --> 00:00:02,960
Of course we're not leaving.

3
00:00:02,985 --> 00:00:04,140
We need to find Anna.

4
00:00:04,165 --> 00:00:06,153
I'm investigating Oksana Ostankova.

5
00:00:06,187 --> 00:00:08,257
I have a few letters from her at home.

6
00:00:08,282 --> 00:00:10,391
She wrote to you in French?

7
00:00:10,424 --> 00:00:14,828
She loved the French lessons
the most. She had a fixation.

8
00:00:14,861 --> 00:00:17,866
Oksana is not dead.
She escaped prison.

9
00:00:17,898 --> 00:00:21,769
Your wife is big and
your daughter is so loud.

10
00:00:21,802 --> 00:00:24,471
- Where are they?
- Screaming in a cupboard somewhere.

11
00:00:24,505 --> 00:00:25,672
Urgh!

12
00:00:27,781 --> 00:00:29,782
The British, they are helping me.

13
00:00:29,816 --> 00:00:31,818
I'm going to give them everything.

14
00:00:31,850 --> 00:00:35,616
This arrived about a month
after he told me she'd died.

15
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:38,624
I'm going to get into the
prison security cameras.

16
00:00:38,709 --> 00:00:40,379
Where are they taking her?

17
00:00:42,904 --> 00:00:44,187
Oh, my God!

18
00:00:51,036 --> 00:00:52,554
Shut up!

19
00:00:53,069 --> 00:00:54,974
Or I'll blow your tiny head to pieces!

20
00:00:55,008 --> 00:00:57,343
My dad is going to kill you in the face!

21
00:00:57,377 --> 00:00:59,452
No, I'm going to kill your dad
in the face.

22
00:00:59,477 --> 00:01:01,847
- No! Why?
- Because he is an arsehole.

23
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:04,184
- You can't say shit about Dad!
- I can!

24
00:01:04,217 --> 00:01:06,593
- You can't!
- Why are you shouting?

25
00:01:06,618 --> 00:01:08,452
- I will kill you!
- I will kill you!

26
00:01:08,468 --> 00:01:10,270
You are going to die!

27
00:01:10,304 --> 00:01:12,673
Ohh! What will make you stop shouting?

28
00:01:12,706 --> 00:01:13,874
Food.

29
00:01:14,015 --> 00:01:15,257
What?

30
00:01:15,622 --> 00:01:17,077
I'm hungry.

31
00:01:18,844 --> 00:01:20,180
Oh.

32
00:01:21,266 --> 00:01:22,683
Okay.

33
00:01:25,785 --> 00:01:26,992
Oh, okay.

34
00:01:27,776 --> 00:01:30,399
Stick out your thumb. Look vulnerable.

35
00:01:31,874 --> 00:01:33,547
I am vulnerable.

37
00:01:52,962 --> 00:01:55,171
- We can't just confront her.
- Oh, we can.

38
00:01:55,196 --> 00:01:57,732
She had no right to visit
Villanelle without asking.

39
00:01:57,765 --> 00:02:00,235
Why? She's not your girlfriend.
It could be totally innocent.

40
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:02,172
I'm sorry if this is difficult for you.

41
00:02:02,197 --> 00:02:04,563
- It's not. I just...
- Are you frightened of your mother?

42
00:02:05,034 --> 00:02:06,953
Of course! Isn't everyone?

43
00:02:07,842 --> 00:02:09,649
If she's involved, she's dangerous.

44
00:02:09,674 --> 00:02:11,328
There's a reason she
went alone and there'll

45
00:02:11,353 --> 00:02:13,013
be a reason she wanted
us back in London.

46
00:02:13,141 --> 00:02:15,116
- We need to respect...
- No, we need to ask her

47
00:02:15,148 --> 00:02:17,289
what the hell she was getting
out of my girlfriend.

48
00:02:20,618 --> 00:02:22,120
We don't even know if she's here.

49
00:02:22,153 --> 00:02:24,563
- You can open her hotel door?
- What?

50
00:02:24,836 --> 00:02:27,621
You must have some
gadgety thing or something?

51
00:02:27,646 --> 00:02:29,219
Um... what? No.

52
00:02:31,586 --> 00:02:34,539
You. I left my key in my room,
number 107. Now.

53
00:02:34,984 --> 00:02:36,422
Of course, madam.

54
00:02:42,703 --> 00:02:44,525
God, it makes me rage
how efficient things are

55
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:46,172
when you're a dick to people.

56
00:02:52,633 --> 00:02:55,203
Can we at least knock once in
case she's naked or something?

57
00:02:58,672 --> 00:03:01,156
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, God, it's been... Jesus!

58
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:03,000
- What the hell?
- Oh.

59
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,775
- Where is Carolyn?
- Mum?

60
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:06,835
Where is she?

61
00:03:09,043 --> 00:03:10,979
I didn't er...

62
00:03:11,733 --> 00:03:13,664
Right, I'm ready to...

63
00:03:14,844 --> 00:03:16,725
- Why aren't you in London?
- Why did you...

64
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:18,642
- Why is he in here?
- Business.

65
00:03:18,675 --> 00:03:20,779
So he sells hairdryers now, does he?

66
00:03:21,242 --> 00:03:23,327
- I was tidying.
- Are you two...

67
00:03:23,352 --> 00:03:24,492
Who is he?

68
00:03:24,545 --> 00:03:28,352
Why aren't you in London? I specifically
told you to return to London.

69
00:03:29,762 --> 00:03:30,906
So?

70
00:03:34,321 --> 00:03:36,007
Villanelle is in the prison.

71
00:03:36,032 --> 00:03:38,568
- She's not.
- Really?

72
00:03:38,602 --> 00:03:40,069
Somebody broke her out.

73
00:03:40,103 --> 00:03:42,173
- What?
- She attacked Konstantin.

74
00:03:42,205 --> 00:03:43,706
Trapped his wife in a cupboard.

75
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:46,510
She's been released and now
she's kidnapped his daughter.

76
00:03:46,543 --> 00:03:47,946
He's come here to ask me for help.

77
00:03:47,971 --> 00:03:50,500
We're... having a little drink.

78
00:03:52,477 --> 00:03:54,133
- Breakfast?
- Yes.

79
00:03:55,555 --> 00:03:57,016
What happened to your room?

80
00:03:57,041 --> 00:03:58,406
What do you mean?

81
00:04:10,664 --> 00:04:11,844
What?

82
00:04:13,594 --> 00:04:15,149
Are you a bad person?

83
00:04:15,208 --> 00:04:16,522
Yup.

84
00:04:17,755 --> 00:04:19,491
- Have you kidnapped me?
- Yup.

85
00:04:20,281 --> 00:04:21,725
Are you a pedophile?

86
00:04:23,796 --> 00:04:25,030
No.

87
00:04:25,055 --> 00:04:26,335
Okay, good.

88
00:04:28,835 --> 00:04:30,264
Why don't you speak Russian?

89
00:04:30,289 --> 00:04:31,644
I don't like it.

90
00:04:32,858 --> 00:04:34,288
Where are we going next?

91
00:04:34,932 --> 00:04:37,167
To get some money
and then to see your dad.

92
00:04:39,366 --> 00:04:40,796
Why didn't you take my mum?

93
00:04:41,157 --> 00:04:42,819
She's too big.

94
00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:46,171
Why is your English so good?

95
00:04:46,887 --> 00:04:48,889
Language is information.

96
00:04:49,306 --> 00:04:50,788
And information...

97
00:04:50,813 --> 00:04:52,553
Is everything.

98
00:04:52,654 --> 00:04:54,092
Yeah, I know.

99
00:04:59,154 --> 00:05:00,653

100
00:05:00,678 --> 00:05:01,912
_

101
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:05,340
_

102
00:05:05,365 --> 00:05:06,552
_

103
00:05:08,146 --> 00:05:09,741
_

104
00:05:14,998 --> 00:05:16,608
You don't know that one, do you?

105
00:05:16,944 --> 00:05:18,335
Is my dad bad?

106
00:05:19,428 --> 00:05:20,971
Yes, he is the worst.

107
00:05:25,881 --> 00:05:27,077
Are you?

108
00:05:27,757 --> 00:05:29,006
I don't know yet.

109
00:05:31,512 --> 00:05:33,415
Is it hard to be bad?

110
00:05:35,234 --> 00:05:36,837
Not if you practice.

111
00:05:40,762 --> 00:05:42,999
Finish that. We're going.

112
00:05:43,967 --> 00:05:46,464
- Where?
- To see an old friend.

113
00:05:48,621 --> 00:05:50,381
_

114
00:05:50,456 --> 00:05:51,608
What?

115
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:55,475
You can't speak Mandarin, can you?

116
00:05:56,738 --> 00:05:57,928
Shut up.

117
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,600
I'm still learning.

118
00:06:02,788 --> 00:06:05,327
Kenny, will you book flights
for you and Eve?

119
00:06:05,352 --> 00:06:06,754
I'll save you some cereal.

120
00:06:13,874 --> 00:06:15,124
What are you...

121
00:06:15,546 --> 00:06:17,538
Why aren't your security services on it?

122
00:06:18,662 --> 00:06:21,065
I thought she might make
contact with you.

123
00:06:21,097 --> 00:06:23,686
- Why?
- You said you'd a connection.

124
00:06:23,711 --> 00:06:27,216
Oh, no, I haven't had any
contact with her since we came.

125
00:06:27,604 --> 00:06:29,600
Why has she taken your daughter?

126
00:06:29,905 --> 00:06:32,460
- So I follow her.
- Why would she want that?

127
00:06:34,806 --> 00:06:36,475
She's been told to kill me.

128
00:06:36,897 --> 00:06:39,842
I'm her next target. And I
don't know where she is.

129
00:06:39,867 --> 00:06:41,869
Why would The Twelve want you dead?

130
00:06:41,936 --> 00:06:45,022
I don't know. I work for
Russian Intelligence.

131
00:06:45,054 --> 00:06:46,656
Someone always wants me dead.

132
00:06:49,103 --> 00:06:51,139
I need to find my daughter.

133
00:06:51,595 --> 00:06:53,866
She's going to drive that woman crazy.

134
00:06:54,255 --> 00:06:56,791
- Is she really annoying?
- She's so annoying.

135
00:07:04,046 --> 00:07:06,509
She's amazing but so annoying.

136
00:07:07,126 --> 00:07:08,594
We should go back to Anna's.

137
00:07:08,986 --> 00:07:10,856
Villanelle's gonna go there.

138
00:07:10,881 --> 00:07:12,436
You've met Anna?

139
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:18,608
Yes.

140
00:07:27,528 --> 00:07:28,830
_

141
00:07:33,008 --> 00:07:34,967
_

142
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:38,330
_

143
00:07:40,307 --> 00:07:42,139
_

144
00:07:55,261 --> 00:07:58,163
Hopefully I'll get to her
before Villanelle does.

145
00:08:00,335 --> 00:08:01,832
I'll bring Anna back here.

146
00:08:01,864 --> 00:08:03,561
Good, then I'll ask Vlad

147
00:08:03,673 --> 00:08:05,514
to organize somewhere for her to stay.

148
00:08:07,186 --> 00:08:10,039
You pack up the base, get
home and we will talk later.

149
00:08:10,073 --> 00:08:11,140
I want to...

150
00:08:11,174 --> 00:08:13,249
You either want a job,
in which case do what I say.

151
00:08:13,345 --> 00:08:16,131
Or you don't want a job, in which
case fend for yourself for once.

152
00:08:20,788 --> 00:08:23,655
Alright, I'm going to Vlad.
Eve, do you need a car?

153
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,022
I'll take her.

154
00:08:25,822 --> 00:08:29,327
- Are you sure you shouldn't...
- No, it's good. Let's do that.

155
00:08:29,831 --> 00:08:31,092
Come.

156
00:08:38,084 --> 00:08:40,702
_

157
00:08:45,798 --> 00:08:49,546
_

158
00:08:55,617 --> 00:08:59,030
_

159
00:09:01,787 --> 00:09:04,452
_

160
00:09:07,390 --> 00:09:10,928
_

161
00:09:11,936 --> 00:09:16,842
_

162
00:09:21,748 --> 00:09:23,748
_

163
00:10:50,954 --> 00:10:52,663
Oksana!

164
00:11:07,101 --> 00:11:08,870
You are an arsehole.

165
00:11:13,794 --> 00:11:15,171
Where is it?

166
00:11:16,014 --> 00:11:18,217
Where is my stuff, my passport,
my money?

167
00:11:18,242 --> 00:11:19,377
I don't know.

168
00:11:19,506 --> 00:11:21,217
- Where is she?
- Who?

169
00:11:21,242 --> 00:11:22,671
Eve Polastri.

170
00:11:23,112 --> 00:11:25,835
I don't know. She
was here to ask me about...

171
00:11:26,996 --> 00:11:29,155
Your face. Your face is hurt.

172
00:11:30,708 --> 00:11:32,178
- Let me...
- No.

173
00:11:32,606 --> 00:11:34,280
Just some disinfectant.

174
00:11:34,897 --> 00:11:36,405
Look at you.

175
00:11:36,698 --> 00:11:38,413
Oksana, please.

176
00:11:40,637 --> 00:11:42,233
She gave me her number.

177
00:11:42,891 --> 00:11:44,202
Give it to me.

178
00:11:46,963 --> 00:11:48,600
You look the same.

179
00:11:52,741 --> 00:11:54,108
You look older.

180
00:11:57,156 --> 00:11:58,499
It's nice.

181
00:12:00,038 --> 00:12:01,092
Can I go?

182
00:12:01,117 --> 00:12:03,621
Don't move your tiny stinking ass.

183
00:12:03,646 --> 00:12:04,952
It's not stinking.

184
00:12:05,413 --> 00:12:10,186
Let me clean your face and then
I will give you her number.

185
00:12:10,633 --> 00:12:12,327
Her face is a mess.

186
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:17,053
_

187
00:12:21,029 --> 00:12:22,694
It does sting a bit.

188
00:13:29,946 --> 00:13:31,947
Are you sure you don't want me to drive?

189
00:13:31,972 --> 00:13:33,374
Yes.

190
00:13:41,746 --> 00:13:43,048
Don't do that!

191
00:13:47,619 --> 00:13:49,092
It won't be long.

192
00:13:51,061 --> 00:13:54,131
You realize I haven't actually
given you the address yet?

193
00:13:54,156 --> 00:13:56,842
You want to tell me how you
know where Anna lives?

194
00:14:12,389 --> 00:14:13,960
It's exactly the same.

195
00:14:16,645 --> 00:14:17,913
Yes.

196
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:19,827
Even his chair.

197
00:14:24,353 --> 00:14:25,436
Yes.

198
00:14:25,461 --> 00:14:28,059
The best sex we
ever had was on that chair.

199
00:14:28,083 --> 00:14:29,546
_

200
00:14:33,970 --> 00:14:35,249
Oh, hello.

201
00:14:35,437 --> 00:14:37,217
_

202
00:14:38,038 --> 00:14:39,577
No, Irina, you stay.

203
00:14:40,422 --> 00:14:42,991
It's an example of someone who
thinks they can shoot a gun.

204
00:14:43,016 --> 00:14:44,788
But they can't. You're safe.

205
00:14:44,997 --> 00:14:49,268
I can. I will shoot your black heart.

206
00:14:49,528 --> 00:14:51,231
Where is Eve's phone number?

207
00:14:51,811 --> 00:14:53,171
I can do it.

208
00:14:54,652 --> 00:14:56,256
What would God say?

209
00:14:56,741 --> 00:14:58,374
He'd understand.

210
00:14:58,448 --> 00:15:00,694
What would He say about doing
it in front of her?

211
00:15:00,719 --> 00:15:02,319
- I don't mind.
- Shut up.

212
00:15:04,484 --> 00:15:06,420
You see, you can't do it.

213
00:15:08,331 --> 00:15:09,546
You can't.

214
00:15:09,571 --> 00:15:14,663
I've spent every night
dreaming that you were alive

215
00:15:14,688 --> 00:15:17,139
so I could shoot you myself.

216
00:15:19,725 --> 00:15:24,467
When your coat came, I prayed
to God that you would come.

217
00:15:24,978 --> 00:15:26,546
Did you two used to go out?

218
00:15:26,837 --> 00:15:28,296
She seduced me.

219
00:15:29,006 --> 00:15:32,227
Oh... come on!

220
00:15:32,252 --> 00:15:33,520
It was you!

221
00:15:34,451 --> 00:15:35,671
Fine.

222
00:15:36,741 --> 00:15:38,147
But can you blame me?

223
00:15:38,394 --> 00:15:40,014
- If you love each other...
- No!

224
00:15:40,647 --> 00:15:42,584
I don't love her anymore.

225
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:46,350
The thing is, I can kill you.

226
00:15:47,676 --> 00:15:48,788
No.

227
00:15:48,895 --> 00:15:50,832
I'm sorry, but yes.

228
00:15:55,568 --> 00:15:57,085
Oh, God!

229
00:16:03,884 --> 00:16:05,366
Get me her phone.

230
00:16:16,035 --> 00:16:17,491
Now look for some money.

231
00:16:18,008 --> 00:16:19,741
We deserve a big lunch.

232
00:16:26,973 --> 00:16:28,350
Why does she want to kill you?

233
00:16:34,198 --> 00:16:37,303
If I told you, I would really
have to kill you, you know?

234
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:42,562
Okay.

235
00:16:42,587 --> 00:16:44,523
No, I really would, huh?

236
00:16:50,634 --> 00:16:51,861
Okay!

237
00:16:53,808 --> 00:16:55,205
I said, okay.

238
00:16:59,977 --> 00:17:01,353
Are you a part of The Twelve?

239
00:17:01,832 --> 00:17:03,025
Oh!

240
00:17:03,217 --> 00:17:04,314
Ohh!

241
00:17:04,703 --> 00:17:06,139
Are you insane?

242
00:17:08,442 --> 00:17:09,681
No!

243
00:17:12,399 --> 00:17:13,837
Who do you think they are?

244
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:16,416
I don't know.

245
00:17:16,830 --> 00:17:18,291
What did she tell you?

246
00:17:18,483 --> 00:17:20,220
- Villanelle?
- Yes.

247
00:17:22,595 --> 00:17:24,587
She said she didn't know
who they were either.

248
00:17:25,205 --> 00:17:27,447
She came to your house?

249
00:17:28,659 --> 00:17:29,791
Yep.

250
00:17:33,826 --> 00:17:36,189
We just need to give her what she wants.

251
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:38,804
- Me.
- No, me.

252
00:17:38,837 --> 00:17:40,873
- Oh, I thought you meant...
- Yes, I told you.

253
00:17:40,905 --> 00:17:44,212
No, I told you she wants to kill me.

254
00:17:44,237 --> 00:17:45,471
Yes.

255
00:17:45,945 --> 00:17:47,259
Well.

256
00:18:11,976 --> 00:18:13,361
She's good.

257
00:18:14,009 --> 00:18:16,931
I've decided. You're a good person.

258
00:18:16,956 --> 00:18:18,783
Oh, really? Why is that?

259
00:18:19,744 --> 00:18:24,056
Because you're sad and sad
people are usually good

260
00:18:24,081 --> 00:18:25,345
because they feel things more.

261
00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:26,666
Oh, God.

262
00:18:27,004 --> 00:18:29,273
You're one of those profound kids.

263
00:18:29,470 --> 00:18:31,724
I am not sad. I have a happy face.

264
00:18:35,646 --> 00:18:37,126
She's perfect.

265
00:18:38,602 --> 00:18:39,797
One more...

266
00:18:40,281 --> 00:18:42,626
and we can go to a really nice place.

267
00:18:57,352 --> 00:18:58,647
Mama!

268
00:19:09,270 --> 00:19:10,835
Give me the money.

269
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:21,452
Hey, don't look!

270
00:19:21,749 --> 00:19:24,100
You know Villanelle! Admit it!

271
00:19:28,615 --> 00:19:29,858
Ooh, whoa!

272
00:19:30,783 --> 00:19:32,296
Don't move your hands.

273
00:19:33,866 --> 00:19:37,222
But my er... I have to put it back.

274
00:19:37,874 --> 00:19:38,960
Don't move them!

275
00:19:40,413 --> 00:19:42,108
Why do you have a gun in your car?

276
00:19:42,210 --> 00:19:45,780
'Cause I'm traveling to save
my daughter from a psychopath.

277
00:19:45,936 --> 00:19:48,306
- From Villanelle?
- Yes.

278
00:19:49,069 --> 00:19:50,335
Does she work for you?

279
00:19:50,888 --> 00:19:53,725
Don't turn around. I don't
want to see it. Oh, Jesus.

280
00:19:56,993 --> 00:19:58,304
Can I put it back?

281
00:19:58,329 --> 00:19:59,663
Yes, yes. Put it back.

282
00:20:07,513 --> 00:20:09,147
Did you recruit her from prison?

283
00:20:09,532 --> 00:20:11,015
Tell me the truth or I'll...

284
00:20:11,903 --> 00:20:13,839
shoot you in the leg.

285
00:20:14,969 --> 00:20:16,647
I recruited her from prison.

286
00:20:17,183 --> 00:20:19,507
For who, Russian Intelligence?

287
00:20:21,267 --> 00:20:22,975
For a private organization.

288
00:20:23,671 --> 00:20:25,069
They trained her.

289
00:20:25,094 --> 00:20:28,832
I... I trained her briefly.

290
00:20:29,193 --> 00:20:31,196
But I haven't seen her in years.

291
00:20:32,225 --> 00:20:34,155
- I don't believe you.
- Listen.

292
00:20:35,126 --> 00:20:38,762
All I know is that I want my daughter,

293
00:20:39,210 --> 00:20:41,637
they want me and you want them.

294
00:20:42,374 --> 00:20:45,324
So bring me to Irina and
they will come to us, okay?

295
00:20:46,129 --> 00:20:50,043
And she will come and
you will get her, me and them.

296
00:20:50,068 --> 00:20:51,410
You will get it all!

297
00:20:53,464 --> 00:20:54,855
Please.

298
00:20:56,646 --> 00:20:58,019
I promise.

299
00:20:58,167 --> 00:20:59,465
I'm not gonna shake your hand.

300
00:20:59,505 --> 00:21:02,480
- Don't be proud.
- I'm not. I'm hygienic.

301
00:21:03,193 --> 00:21:04,528
Shake my wrist.

302
00:21:08,524 --> 00:21:09,659
Anna.

303
00:21:09,684 --> 00:21:10,824
Hello?

304
00:21:11,054 --> 00:21:12,738
Where is my passport?

305
00:21:13,817 --> 00:21:15,621
I have it. Where's Irina?

306
00:21:15,830 --> 00:21:17,933
- I have it.
- I'm with her father.

307
00:21:18,098 --> 00:21:19,137
Perfect.

308
00:21:19,162 --> 00:21:22,746
Do you want some tea?
We are going to Caf� Radozhny.

309
00:21:24,762 --> 00:21:26,032
Get in the car.

310
00:21:26,309 --> 00:21:27,652
I'm keeping this.

311
00:21:29,465 --> 00:21:31,043
Caf� Radozhny.

312
00:21:36,447 --> 00:21:38,066
Have you been on a plane before?

313
00:21:38,149 --> 00:21:40,051
We can't. You don't have my passport.

314
00:21:40,396 --> 00:21:41,816
- Yes, I do.
- Hey!

315
00:21:41,841 --> 00:21:45,308
- Your photo is hilarious.
- Stop it! I was young then!

316
00:21:46,374 --> 00:21:47,722
Your hair!

317
00:21:50,369 --> 00:21:52,660
- Dad!
- Irina!

318
00:21:55,067 --> 00:21:56,335
Whoa!

319
00:21:58,748 --> 00:22:00,783
That's right, ladies, a child could die.

320
00:22:00,808 --> 00:22:02,109
- Damn you!
- Shut up.

321
00:22:02,432 --> 00:22:05,293
Please stop moving or I will
shoot someone. I'm desperate.

322
00:22:05,318 --> 00:22:07,097
- Oksana!
- Ooh!

323
00:22:07,878 --> 00:22:10,614
- Suits you.
- Just tell me what you want.

324
00:22:11,061 --> 00:22:12,301
Him.

325
00:22:14,645 --> 00:22:17,480
Not here. I'll come with you.

326
00:22:17,749 --> 00:22:19,551
She is really annoying.

327
00:22:20,155 --> 00:22:21,322
I know.

328
00:22:23,398 --> 00:22:24,934
I like her.

329
00:22:25,567 --> 00:22:26,746
Me too.

330
00:22:27,038 --> 00:22:29,140
I've got your passport and your cash.

331
00:22:29,165 --> 00:22:31,230
Just let Irina go
and I'll give them to you.

332
00:22:31,255 --> 00:22:32,910
- Throw it.
- I will if you...

333
00:22:32,935 --> 00:22:34,488
No, no...

334
00:22:35,549 --> 00:22:37,465
You don't know what to do with that.

335
00:22:38,612 --> 00:22:40,269
I know. I'm going to put it down.

336
00:22:41,586 --> 00:22:43,769
- I'm not here to hurt anyone.
- Throw it!

337
00:22:44,123 --> 00:22:46,026
- Throw it.
- Throw it.

338
00:22:52,246 --> 00:22:54,137
Excuse me. Could you
pass that along, please?

339
00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:55,887
Thank you so much.

340
00:22:56,824 --> 00:22:59,402
Ooh! Thank you, Eve.

341
00:23:02,943 --> 00:23:06,446
Villanelle. Don't break my heart.

342
00:23:07,329 --> 00:23:09,019
Don't break mine.

343
00:23:11,448 --> 00:23:12,738
You either.

344
00:23:13,742 --> 00:23:15,801
- Who's your favorite?
- What?

345
00:23:15,911 --> 00:23:17,313
Me or her?

346
00:23:20,838 --> 00:23:23,144
It's me... isn't it?

347
00:23:23,241 --> 00:23:24,465
A little bit.

348
00:23:24,986 --> 00:23:26,457
- Yes.
- Hey!

349
00:23:26,482 --> 00:23:28,402
Then you won't miss her so much, huh?

350
00:23:29,555 --> 00:23:30,785
What do you want?

351
00:23:30,810 --> 00:23:33,957
I want to do my job so I can
go home and have a bath.

352
00:23:34,851 --> 00:23:36,113
Okay.

353
00:23:36,754 --> 00:23:39,652
Okay, do your job.
But she is not your job.

354
00:23:44,631 --> 00:23:46,402
You know we've never had sex?

355
00:23:47,147 --> 00:23:48,316
Weird, huh?

356
00:23:48,804 --> 00:23:51,207
- I'm married.
- You're romantic.

357
00:23:53,096 --> 00:23:54,676
And you're a good person...

358
00:23:55,470 --> 00:23:56,652
I think.

359
00:23:59,698 --> 00:24:02,584
But I have to do my job
and you understand that.

360
00:24:02,609 --> 00:24:04,154
- No, no, no...
- Oksana, no!

361
00:24:17,659 --> 00:24:20,185
Come with me. Just you and me.

362
00:24:27,367 --> 00:24:28,638
Please.

363
00:24:29,851 --> 00:24:31,365
Just you and me.

364
00:24:49,672 --> 00:24:50,708
Ohh!

365
00:24:55,436 --> 00:24:56,740
Spasibo.

366
00:25:02,333 --> 00:25:05,865
- Konstantin?
- I'm afraid so.

367
00:25:08,690 --> 00:25:10,093
There goes that lead.

368
00:25:16,931 --> 00:25:18,365
Do you want a cheese puff?

369
00:25:18,858 --> 00:25:20,693
- Did you bring them with you?
- Always.

370
00:25:21,185 --> 00:25:22,576
Are they the normal flavor?

371
00:25:22,988 --> 00:25:25,191
Well, there's only one
cheese puff flavor.

372
00:25:25,287 --> 00:25:27,890
Oh, okay. No, thanks.

373
00:25:28,492 --> 00:25:30,115
First new message...

374
00:25:30,140 --> 00:25:31,427
Okay, I've got a lead.

375
00:25:31,452 --> 00:25:34,474
An apartment in Paris where
a young man was found dead.

376
00:25:34,548 --> 00:25:35,990
He had an asthma attack.

377
00:25:36,023 --> 00:25:39,045
The same chemical was found
in his lungs as the politician.

378
00:25:39,178 --> 00:25:41,423
I checked the other residents
of the building, just

379
00:25:41,448 --> 00:25:44,251
because you're all in Russia
and I have nothing to do.

380
00:25:44,276 --> 00:25:46,951
One of the apartments
is paid for by the same account

381
00:25:46,976 --> 00:25:48,099
that paid Frank.

382
00:25:48,124 --> 00:25:50,263
I've sent you the address. Let
me know when you want to go.

383
00:25:50,288 --> 00:25:52,802
Please take me with you! I'm dying here!

384
00:25:56,675 --> 00:25:57,771
Who was that?

385
00:25:58,809 --> 00:25:59,990
Nico.

386
00:26:00,772 --> 00:26:02,381
Well, that's a good reason to go home.

387
00:26:04,662 --> 00:26:08,552
I believe that you both handed
over my private correspondence

388
00:26:09,252 --> 00:26:12,591
with Konstantin Vasiliev to
Vlad, in exchange for Nadia.

389
00:26:13,298 --> 00:26:14,975
A dirty move but a good one.

390
00:26:15,806 --> 00:26:17,873
I'm sorry it had to end this way.

391
00:26:18,375 --> 00:26:21,193
It looks like I'm going to have
to finish this on my own.

392
00:26:21,892 --> 00:26:24,912
You can both pack up the London office.

393
00:26:26,924 --> 00:26:28,662
I'm sure you both understand.

394
00:26:32,791 --> 00:26:34,959
Pass me my bags, please.

395
00:27:13,003 --> 00:27:14,388
London?

396
00:27:16,570 --> 00:27:17,857
London?

397
00:27:19,956 --> 00:27:21,248
Um...

398
00:27:22,545 --> 00:27:23,701
No.

399
00:27:59,779 --> 00:28:01,857
- Oui?
- Bonjour.

400
00:28:02,115 --> 00:28:03,582
Parlez-vous anglais?

401
00:28:04,037 --> 00:28:05,449
I don't like to.

402
00:28:05,701 --> 00:28:07,003
But I can.

403
00:28:07,028 --> 00:28:10,107
Um... I'm looking for this woman.

404
00:28:11,344 --> 00:28:13,787
Er... Julie, yes.

405
00:28:15,005 --> 00:28:16,568
Are you...

406
00:28:18,196 --> 00:28:21,162
Um... from the...

407
00:28:22,216 --> 00:28:23,718
Yes.

408
00:28:23,743 --> 00:28:25,213
Yes, I am.

409
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:27,236
- Really?
- Yes.

410
00:28:28,653 --> 00:28:32,193
I just want to make sure
everything is in order.

411
00:28:32,896 --> 00:28:36,847
It's nice to actually meet someone.

412
00:28:36,881 --> 00:28:38,240
Erm...

413
00:28:39,334 --> 00:28:41,646
...do you need to see my records?

414
00:28:43,107 --> 00:28:45,162
Um... yes.

415
00:28:45,732 --> 00:28:50,896
I had my spyhole moved down so
that I could sit by the door.

416
00:28:51,441 --> 00:28:53,466
You paid for it, though.

417
00:28:54,117 --> 00:28:55,193
Ah.

418
00:28:55,420 --> 00:28:57,295
Here that morning...

419
00:28:57,669 --> 00:29:00,099
...she had only her underwear on.

420
00:29:02,506 --> 00:29:04,787
Then her brother came.

421
00:29:05,107 --> 00:29:06,244
Her brother?

422
00:29:06,474 --> 00:29:09,006
I don't think he was her brother.

423
00:29:09,092 --> 00:29:11,094
He came here a lot, though.

424
00:29:11,128 --> 00:29:12,381
What did he look like?

425
00:29:12,841 --> 00:29:15,060
Grey hair, beard.

426
00:29:15,105 --> 00:29:16,506
Nice-looking.

427
00:29:16,974 --> 00:29:19,269
A bit like un ours.

428
00:29:19,576 --> 00:29:21,224
Un ours?

429
00:29:21,249 --> 00:29:23,452
Un ours. Raar!

430
00:29:25,046 --> 00:29:26,177
Okay.

431
00:29:28,164 --> 00:29:29,474
Is...

432
00:29:30,528 --> 00:29:31,779
Is this him?

433
00:29:32,322 --> 00:29:34,099
Ah, oui. Yes.

434
00:29:34,124 --> 00:29:35,685
- Yes.
- Merci.

435
00:29:36,285 --> 00:29:37,615
Uh...

436
00:29:37,813 --> 00:29:41,271
we're trying to make
the system more efficient

437
00:29:41,990 --> 00:29:44,498
and would like you
to text me your reports

438
00:29:44,523 --> 00:29:46,334
- instead of writing them down.
- Okay.

439
00:29:47,131 --> 00:29:48,810
Give me your number.

440
00:29:49,498 --> 00:29:52,134
I haven't seen her in a while, though.

441
00:29:52,447 --> 00:29:55,638
Any sign of her at all would be good.

442
00:29:56,968 --> 00:29:58,201
Thank you.

443
00:30:03,103 --> 00:30:04,287
Merci.

444
00:30:30,424 --> 00:30:32,451
Would you like a key?

445
00:31:29,336 --> 00:31:30,779
Are you kidding me?

446
00:34:39,766 --> 00:34:42,135
Did you have a party or something?

447
00:34:43,973 --> 00:34:46,673
I have lost two jobs,

448
00:34:46,698 --> 00:34:49,034
a husband and a best friend
because of you.

449
00:34:49,330 --> 00:34:50,482
Yeah.

450
00:34:51,504 --> 00:34:53,904
But you got some really nice
clothes out of it, so...

451
00:34:57,579 --> 00:34:59,388
What are you going to do with that?

452
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:03,450
- I'm gonna kill you.
- No, you're not.

453
00:35:03,475 --> 00:35:04,590
- I am.
- You're not.

454
00:35:04,615 --> 00:35:07,020
- I am.
- You like me too much.

455
00:35:11,754 --> 00:35:13,568
So what now, Eve?

456
00:35:15,186 --> 00:35:16,802
I'm gonna tell you something.

457
00:35:17,104 --> 00:35:18,318
Sit down.

458
00:35:47,788 --> 00:35:49,452
I think about you all the time.

459
00:35:50,754 --> 00:35:52,405
I think about what you're wearing

460
00:35:52,709 --> 00:35:55,280
and what you're doing
and who you're doing it with.

461
00:35:55,345 --> 00:35:57,100
I think about what friends you have.

462
00:35:57,377 --> 00:35:59,380
I think about what you eat
before you work

463
00:35:59,405 --> 00:36:02,843
and what shampoo you use and
what happened in your family.

464
00:36:03,265 --> 00:36:06,085
I think about your eyes and your mouth

465
00:36:06,110 --> 00:36:08,796
and what you feel when you kill someone.

466
00:36:08,821 --> 00:36:10,897
I think about
what you have for breakfast.

467
00:36:10,922 --> 00:36:13,764
I just... want to know everything.

468
00:36:16,411 --> 00:36:17,889
I think about you too.

469
00:36:21,382 --> 00:36:23,885
I mean, I masturbate about you a lot.

470
00:36:24,198 --> 00:36:25,788
- Okay, that...
- Too much?

471
00:36:25,814 --> 00:36:28,186
No, it's just I wasn't expecting that.

472
00:36:32,748 --> 00:36:37,586
So you trash my apartment
because you like me so much?

473
00:36:39,175 --> 00:36:41,311
I... I know
it's not conventional.

474
00:36:43,990 --> 00:36:45,288
What do you want?

475
00:36:45,936 --> 00:36:47,805
Honestly. Don't be a dick.

476
00:36:49,668 --> 00:36:51,061
Normal stuff.

477
00:36:53,837 --> 00:36:55,202
A nice life.

478
00:36:56,215 --> 00:36:57,514
Cool flat.

479
00:36:58,097 --> 00:36:59,389
Fun job.

480
00:37:02,547 --> 00:37:04,210
Someone to watch movies with.

481
00:37:17,781 --> 00:37:19,241
God, I'm tired.

482
00:37:33,785 --> 00:37:35,421
Aren't you tired?

483
00:37:37,588 --> 00:37:38,990
A little, yeah.

484
00:38:10,436 --> 00:38:12,186
You found me.

485
00:38:12,854 --> 00:38:14,202
Yes.

486
00:38:16,128 --> 00:38:17,475
Well done.

487
00:38:20,573 --> 00:38:21,804
Thank you.

488
00:38:28,895 --> 00:38:30,343
Are you gonna kill me?

489
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:37,179
Promise?

490
00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:39,202
Promise.

491
00:39:03,657 --> 00:39:05,139
Would you stay for a bit?

492
00:39:14,727 --> 00:39:16,007
Sure.

493
00:39:27,957 --> 00:39:30,493
I've never done anything
like this before.

494
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:32,319
It's okay.

495
00:39:33,734 --> 00:39:35,194
I know what I'm doing.

496
00:39:37,334 --> 00:39:38,530
Wow!

497
00:39:41,848 --> 00:39:43,883
- That's rude.
- Yeah.

498
00:39:46,133 --> 00:39:48,249
- You can't.
- I can.

499
00:39:51,559 --> 00:39:53,094
I can!

500
00:40:01,884 --> 00:40:03,585
I really liked you.

501
00:40:04,110 --> 00:40:05,460
It hurts!

502
00:40:06,497 --> 00:40:07,843
Don't pull it.

503
00:40:07,955 --> 00:40:10,014
What did I just say?

504
00:40:13,456 --> 00:40:14,882
Okay... Okay, hold on!

505
00:40:14,907 --> 00:40:16,100
Hold on, it's okay!

506
00:40:17,745 --> 00:40:19,522
Just... put your hand there.

507
00:40:19,547 --> 00:40:21,929
I got you, I got you.
I'm gonna get some...

508
00:40:22,597 --> 00:40:23,788
Wait there!

509
00:40:25,147 --> 00:40:27,083
Oh! Oh, shit!

510
00:40:37,493 --> 00:40:38,819
Put that down!

511
00:40:39,999 --> 00:40:42,202
Put it down! I need to help you!

512
00:40:43,619 --> 00:40:45,499
What are you doing?

513
00:40:45,848 --> 00:40:47,303
I'm coming out.

514
00:40:48,608 --> 00:40:50,038
I'm coming out!

515
00:41:01,330 --> 00:41:02,633
She has gone.

516
00:41:08,481 --> 00:41:09,617
Where?
